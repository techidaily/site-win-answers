 Office 2011 for Mac is going to be released in a couple of days, and we got our hands on the latest version already. Here's a quick tour of some of the new features in the latest version of Office. This new release brings many features from Office for Windows that have been missing or have not worked the same---for instance, Office now includes the Ribbon interface, and replaces Entourage with Outlook. 

##  Mac Office Integrates the Ribbon

 Microsoft has brought the Ribbon UI to the Mac and has done it in a way they think Mac users will appreciate---they have taken their research of user's experiences and grouped the most used tools together to allow for a better experience when working with your documents. You'll notice that they did a really good job of combining the Ribbon with a more Mac-like feel. Here's part of the Ribbon for Microsoft Outlook, which has all the most common tools on the toolbar.

[](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/41.png) You'll also notice that the "Save As" key command of Command + Shift + S has been brought back to the suite, allowing cross-platform users to have the ease of use they may have missed in Office for Mac 2008\.

##  Collaboration Tools without a Plugin

 Office:mac 2008 did have the ability to share your documents though the plugin that was available, but now you can use your companies SharePoint servers or share your documents with others using Microsoft's SkyDrive.
