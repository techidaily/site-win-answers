4. Click**Exit** .

 After confirming that your device is powerful enough to run the game, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 If your game files are missing or corrupted, you’re more likely to encounter crashing issues in FNAF Security Breach. To rule out this issue, you can verify the integrity of game files via Steam. Here’s how:

1. Launch**Steam** and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click**Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach** and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/steam-properties.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once the process is complete, relaunch the game and check if the crashing issue persists.

If this method gives you no luck, go for the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics cards are essential to video games. To get the best performance out of your hardware, you should keep your graphics driver up to date. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, FNAF Security Breach crashing is more likely to occur.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing it step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install it manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
