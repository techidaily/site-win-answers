### Fix 1: Uninstall incompatible software

 Sometimes the third party software can interfere with your game. So uninstall the newly installed software to see whether it can help. If you have Razer Chroma SDK, Razer Synapse or Roccat Mouse driver installed on your PC, you’d better uninstall it and see whether it solves the Frostpunk crash issue.  
 Except for these drivers, your antivirus software may be the reason for the Frostpunk crash issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Fix 2: Reinstall the game

 Fully uninstalling and reinstalling the game is an old easy but effective method. The game profile can be crashed which cause the Frostpunk crash. So doing a clean reinstall can fix the issue.

If it doesn’t work, you can move to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics card driver

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.
