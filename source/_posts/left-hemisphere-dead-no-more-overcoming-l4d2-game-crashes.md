### Fix 6: Modify the paging file size

 If the game crash issues were caused by the insufficient RAM, you can apply this fix to see if it works. Before modifying the paging file, you need to check if The Division 2 crash issue was triggered by the insufficient RAM.

 To check it, you need to view crash logs in Windows OS. If you don’t know how to do it, you can refer to the post[How to view crash logs in Windows 10](https://www.supereasy.com/how-to-view-crash-logs-in-windows-10/) .

 If the source of the event is called “Resource-Exhaustion-Detector”, then you can follow the steps below to modify the paging files:

 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog, then type**control** and press**Enter** to open Control Panel.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-146.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-153.png)

 **Do not disable the paging file or modify it to 0 MB or a static value** even if your PC has sufficient RAM, since if you doing that, it usually causes crashes in the game.
