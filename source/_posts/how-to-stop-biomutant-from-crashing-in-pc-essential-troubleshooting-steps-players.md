**7)** Relaunch and play Oxygen Not Included.

If the game crashing issue persists, check the fix below.

### Fix 6:**Install** Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Runtime

 **What is Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 runtime?**
 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is a set of runtime library files used by many programs installed on your computer, even a part of Windows. If something wrong goes with it, some of your programs may not be able to function properly.

 Oxygen Not Included crashing issues might happen when Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Runtime is not properly installed on your PC. In this case, you’ll need to reinstall it. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Download**Microsoft Visual C++ 2015** from[**the Microsoft website**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) .

**2)** Open the**downloaded file** and follow the on-screen instructions to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 runtime.

**3)** Restart your computer and your game to test your issue.

 This should fix your problem. If it didn’t, don’t fret. Check the fix below.

### Fix 7:**Update your Graphics driver**

 Another common cause of Oxygen Not Included crashing issues is an outdated or a faulty graphics driver. Try updating your graphics driver to see if that’s the problem for you. There are 2 ways you can do it:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-oxygen-not-included-crashing-pc/#g2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer support website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 8:**Check for Windows updates**

 Windows Updates can also address bugs related to both hardware and software. So make sure you’ve installed all the new Windows Updates to keep Oxygen Not Included from crashing. Here is how to do it:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type**windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-575.png)
