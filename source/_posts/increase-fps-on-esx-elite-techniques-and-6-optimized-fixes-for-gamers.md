## 1\. Enable game mode

 Now launch Battlefield 2042\. If your game still stutters a lot or it’s showing pretty low FPS, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Disable overlays

 Plenty of voice chat and graphics applications have overlays to improve your experience with games. But sometimes they do the opposite of that. In this case, you’ll need to disable them.

Below are a few common overlays and how to disable them.

#### Discord

1. Open Discord.
2. Click the **cogwheel icon** at the bottom of the left pane to open Settings.

 After disabling overlays, launch Battlefield 2042 and it should run smoothly.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When you encounter performance issues with your game, it’s high time you consider if you’re using an outdated graphics driver. Outdated drivers can introduce compatibility issues.

 Another reason you should check for driver updates is that famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. So this is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network adapter driver manually, you can, instead, do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

## 4\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

 If you have the latest Windows version, a Geforce 10 series or later/ Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card with the latest driver, you can try to enable**hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** , a feature that is designed to provide users with a performance boost. To enable this feature, follow the instructions below.

1. Right-click on the empty space from your desktop and select **Display settings** .  

![enable hardware-acceleration GPU scheduling](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/display-settings-1.png)
2. Scroll down. Find **Graphics settings** and click on it.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
3. Toggle**On** Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/graphics-settings.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-BF2042.png)
6. Your game should appear on the list. Click on the**Options** button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/options-button.png)
7. Select**High Performance** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/high-performance.png)

 Tips: If you’re not sure how to locate your game’s installation folder, head to Steam. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Manage > Browse local files** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/browse-local-file.png)

 After this, restart your computer to make sure it’s applied. Then test your gameplay. If disabling hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling doesn’t make any difference, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Delete the cache for the game

 Some players reported on Reddit that deleting the game cache helped them reduce the in-game stutters. So you can give it a try and see how it works.

1. Head to**C/Users/username/Documents/Battlefield 2042** or directly go to the**Document** folder on your PC.
2. Open the**Cache** folder. Press**Ctrl + A** keys simultaneously to select all the files. Then right-click and select Delete to delete all the files.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/delete-cache.png)

If this doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 6\. Tweak in-game settings

 For some reason, settings by default may not always give you the best result. To make sure you can enjoy Battlefield 2042 to the fullest on your own computer, adjust the following in-game settings:

* Future frame rendering:**OFF**
* Vertical sync:**OFF**
