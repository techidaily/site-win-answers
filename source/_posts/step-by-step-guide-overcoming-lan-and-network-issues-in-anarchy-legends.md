<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Discord-enable-in-game-overlay-1-1200x714.jpg)

 Run your game to see if your **Discord overlay** shows up. If not, try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Run Discord as administrator

 If you didn’t run**Discord** as administrator, you may encounter the**Discord overlay** not working issue. Try running your**Discord** as**administrator** to see if this problem persists. Here is how to do it:

 1) On your desktop,**right-click** the shortcut of **Discord** and then select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap7.jpg)

 3) On your desktop, double-click the shortcut of**Discord** to open it.

 4) Run your game again.

See if this issue reappears. If not, you have fixed this issue.

### Fix 3: Add Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application

 If you’re using a third-party antivirus application on your PC, you may encounter the**Discord overlay** not working issue. Your third-party antivirus application may interfere with**Discord** , so your **Discord overlay** may not run as expected. You can try   **adding your Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

### Fix 4: Check for software interruption

 Maybe the**Discord overlay** not working issue is also triggered by the interruption from other applications running on your PC. Try**temporarily disabling them** to see if your**Discord overlay** works or not. If you’re running**the programs that have the overlay features** , or you’re running**the programs that can access your microphone** , they may interfere with your**Discord overlay** .

**Programs like screen recorders**  are most likely to interfere with your **Discord overlay** .

### Fix 5: Disable hardware acceleration in Discord

 Hardware acceleration is a feature in**Discord** that uses your GPU to make**Discord** smoother. However, many users have reported that sometimes, this feature may cause the**Discord overlay** to not work.

 If you turned on the hardware acceleration feature in**Discord** and the**Discord overlay** does not work issue occurs, try**disabling hardware acceleration in Discord** . Follow the instructions below to check whether you turned on the hardware acceleration feature or not:

 1) Open your**Discord** , Click **the gear button** to open **User Settings** .
