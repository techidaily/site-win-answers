## 1\. Check the minimum system requirements

 Starfield has rather high requirements for your computer, especially when compared to other games. So if your Starfield is experiencing audio issues, like it’s cutting in and out a lot, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Starfield to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

| Minimum          | Recommended                                |                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| OS               | Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)       | Windows 10/11 with updates                     |
| Processor        | AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K     | AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K             |
| Memory           | 16 GB RAM                                  | 16 GB RAM                                      |
| Graphics         | AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti | AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 |
| DirectX          | Version 12                                 | Version 12                                     |
| Storage          | 125 GB available space                     | 125 GB available space                         |
| Additional Notes | SSD Required (Solid-state Drive)           | SSD Required (Solid-state Drive)               |

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information:[**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

 When you’re sure that your machine meets the system requirements to run the game, but Starfield audio still cuts in and out, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 2\. Install Starfield on an SSD

 As mentioned above, Starfield has such high requirements for players’ computers that an SSD is required for Starfield to be installed. So if your Starfield is constantly having audio issues, like its sound cut in and out frequently, please make sure that it’s installed on an SSD instead of an HDD.

To tell which drive you have, please view the Task Manager:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. Click the second icon (**Performance** ), then check the **Type** field.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-12.png)
3. To make sure that you have the best gaming experience with Starfield and are free from the pain of constant audio issues, it’s highly recommended that you install the game on your SSD.

 If your Starfield audio still cuts out when you have it installed on the SSD, please move on to the other fixes below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Turn off VSync or VRS

 VSync (Vertical Sync) is designed to fix screen tearing and screen stuttering by syncing the refresh rate with the frame rate of your monitor. When the game’s frame rate is too high for your monitor to keep up, not only will you notice the eye-soring screen tearing, but also audio cutting in and out sometimes. To fix it, you can change the VSync settings for your display card.

* **[If you have an Nvidia display card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[If you have an AMD display card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### **To enable VSync in NVIDIA Control Panel:**

1. On your desktop, right-click in an empty space and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

2. In the left pane, select **Manage 3D Settings** and choose **Global Settings** . Then find **Vertical sync** and click the drop-down menu on the right. Select **On**  and click **Apply** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3d-settings.png)

 Setting Vertical sync to **Adaptive** might also be efficient, according to some players.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **If you have an AMD display card, modify the Wait for Vertical Refresh setting:**

1. On your keyboard, hit the **Windows** key and type **amd** . Then click **AMD Radeon Software** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMD-software.jpg)
2. On the top right corner of the menu, click the settings icon. Then select the **Graphics**  tab and navigate to **Wait for Vertical Refresh** . Click the small arrow on its right to open the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/amd-graphics.jpg)
3. Click **Always on** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/amd-verticle-refresh-on.jpg)

 NVIDIA and AMD settings will default to application settings. It means that they will respect in-game settings. If you select Always On for NVIDIA/AMD in-game, then VSYNC will remain On when appropriate.

 Try Starfield again to see if its audio issue is fixed. If the problem still persists, please move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Update audio and graphics drivers

 Outdated or incorrect display card and sound card drivers could also be the culprit to your Starfield’s audio cutting in and out problem, so if the above two methods don’t help to restore your Starfield audio back to normal, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics and/or audio driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics and audio driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

And the website of your audio manufacturer:

* [**Realtek**](https://www.realtek.com/en/)
* [**Creative**](https://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster)

 Then search for your GPU and sound card models. Note that you should only download the latest driver installers that are compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installers and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics and audio drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Launch Starfield again and see if the latest graphics and audio drivers help to fix its audio issues. If this fix doesn’t work for you, try the next fix, below.

## 5\. Run Steam as an admin

 If Starfield lacks administrative privileges, which ensure that you have full rights to do anything it needs on your computer, it’ll fail to launch properly as well. To check if that’s your case, you can try running it as an administrator:

1. Right-click your **Steam** desktop icon and select **Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0"> vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External/Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders. 
This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-56.png)
2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-57.png)
3. You may also want to tick the box for **Run this program in compatibility mode for:**  then select **Windows 8** from the dropdown list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-58.png)

 Now openStarfield again (it should be opened with administrative permission), to see if its audio is back to normal again. If there are still issues with the Starfield audio, please move on to the next fix.

---

## 6\. Verify game files

 Corrupted or missing files will also cause audio problems for your Starfield. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on:

1. Launch the Steam app and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** , then **right-click** Starfield and select **Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png" border="0">Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steam-properties.jpg)
2. Click **Installed Files** , and click **Verify Integrity of game files.** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-48.png)
3. Then wait for the process to be done – it could take several minutes.

 When the verification is done, launch Starfield again to see if its audio still cuts in and out.
