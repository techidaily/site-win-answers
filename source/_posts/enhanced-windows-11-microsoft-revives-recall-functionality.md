## Enhanced Windows 11: Microsoft Revives Recall Functionality

The Recall feature in Windows 11 was one of Microsoft’s biggest mistakes in recent memory. Microsoft has now confirmed that it will start testing a modified version soon in the Windows 11 Insider builds.

 Recall was one of the AI-powered features created for [Copilot+ PCs](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), giving you a visual history of everything on your PC accessible with a timeline and search box. For example, if you can’t remember where you saw an important message or product, you could search for it in Recall. However, the feature was [quickly panned](https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e) by [security experts](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwwqp6nx14o), since the screenshots captured by Recall and its text database were saved in folders easily accessible by other applications. That would be a tempting target for malware, and it also wasn’t clear how much of that information Windows would send to cloud services for processing.

Microsoft

 Microsoft [announced in June](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-of-yt-a-deep-dive-into-music-dance-clips-23/) that it would make significant changes to Recall, including encrypting the text and screenshot database, making it an opt-in feature, and requiring Windows Hello authentication for access. The company didn’t finish those changes in time for the first wave of Copilot+ PCs on June 18th, 2024, such as the [Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-complete-control-over-your-youtube-viewing-experience/), so it was turned off completely.

 The updated version of Copilot will soon be available to test for Windows Insiders, starting in October. The company said in a blog post, “we have adjusted our release approach to leverage the valuable expertise of our Windows Insider community prior to making Recall available for all Copilot+ PCs. Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish a blog with more details.”

 Microsoft has still not announced plans to bring Recall to more Windows 11 PCs. Even when it fully rolls out, where it will _hopefully_ be an opt-in toggle, the feature will only be available on Copilot+ PCs. If you don’t have one of those, you can ignore all of it.
