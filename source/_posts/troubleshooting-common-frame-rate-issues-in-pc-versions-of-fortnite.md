5. [**Scan and repair corrupt game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Turn off overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Check the Diablo 2 Resurrected minimum system requirement

 If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run a demanding game like Diablo 2 Resurrected, you may run into the crashes constantly. That’s why you should always check the game’s minimum system requirements before you proceed to the more advanced steps.

| **Minimum**   | **Recommended**                   |                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **OS**        | Windows 10                        | Windows 10                            |
| **Processor** | Intel Core i3-3250 AMD FX-4350    | Intel Core i5-9600k AMD Ryzen 5 2600  |
| **Video**     | Nvidia GTX 660 AMD Radeon HD 7850 | Nvidia GTX 1060 AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                          | 16 GB RAM                             |

 If you don’t know how to check your computer specs, simply follow this guide:[How to find computer specs on Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If your machine isn’t up for the game, considering upgrading your PC first.

### Fix 2 – Stop overclocking

 By overclocking your CPU and GPU, you may see a significant boost in the game performance. However, doing this can sometimes lead to problems like instability in the system and crashes your game. So if Diablo 2 Resurrected keeps crashing after an overclock, you may want to**turn off all the overclocking utilities** such as MSI Afterburner and**reset your processor to the default** .

If this method doesn’t help, check out your graphics driver.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver is essential to a smooth gaming experience. If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, Diablo 2 Resurrected crashing is more likely to occur. To fix it, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

 You can search for the newest graphics driver that corresponds with your operating system from the GPU manufacturer’s website such as[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , and then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Restart your computer for the changes to take effect and test if the issue persists. If yes, don’t frustrate, and move on to the following fixes.

### Fix 4 – Run the game as an administrator

 Some games may require an administrator-level to run, or else it will crash at startup or during the gameplay. If that’s the cause, running Diablo 2 Resurrected as an administrator should resolve the permission issue. Here is how:

1. Go to the game’s installation folder.
2. Right-click the Diablo 2 Resurrected executable (.exe) file and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/run-as-administrator-1.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick**Run this program as an administrator** and**Disable fullscreen optimizations** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-as-administrator-diablo-2-1.jpg)
4. Click**OK** to save the changes.

1. Open the Battle.net launcher and select**Diablo 2 Resurrected** from the top pane.
2. At the bottom, click the**gear icon** next to the Play button and select**Scan and Repair** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Wait a few minutes until the process completes, and restart your game to see if the problem is fixed. If not, try the next solution.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-2-1.jpg)
