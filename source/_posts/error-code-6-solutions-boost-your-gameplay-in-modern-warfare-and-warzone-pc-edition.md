### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 A broken or outdated graphics driver can trigger a variety of gaming issues such as constant stuttering or massive FPS drops. If you’re playing AAA titles like Elden Ring with high system requirements, you should definitely update your graphics driver to gain the best in-game experience.

To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, here are two options for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : Major GPU manufacturers release new drivers regularly. You can go to their websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , find the latest driver corresponding with your operating system, and download it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 If you’re using a laptop or multi-GPU system, make sure the dedicated GPU is properly utilized. If not, you’ll see huge FPS drops and it’s better to tweak the settings for maximum performance

### Fix 5 – Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator
