## 1\. Check the Roblox server

 When you see error code 277 in Roblox, you should first check the game server status to make sure that this is not a problem on your end: more often than not, error code 277 is a problem with the game server, and there’s nothing more for you to do other than wait for the devs to get their server fixed.

 To check Roblox’s server status, you can visit this page:[https://status.roblox.com/pages/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d](https://status.roblox.com/pages/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d)

 If there’s indeed a problem with Roblox’s server, you’ll see a notification like this:

 If you’re seeing**All Systems Operational** , but you’re still getting error code 277 on your side in Roblox, please move on to other fixes, as it could be a problem with your network.

## 2\. Revisit your network settings

 If you’ve made sure that Roblox’s server is running just fine, but you’re still getting the error code 277 on your side, it’s probably an issue with your network settings.

 There are some tweaks that you can do with your router to improve your network connectivity, and thus reduce the chance of getting error code 277 in Roblox. Check the following to see if you’ve done them all:

* **Don’t use any VPN or proxy services** : this is by far the most mentioned reason why error code 277 is seen in Roblox.
* **Reduce the number of devices connected to the same router** to ensure your main computer gets the most speed.
* **Use a wired network connection** (with an Ethernet cable) instead of Wi-Fi. If this is not an option, move your computer closer to the router.
* **Play on your local server** . If that’s not an option, choose one that is closest to you.
* **Update your router firmware** if you haven’t already.
* In your router settings, try to **enable QoS to prioritize gaming traffic** . If you’re not sure where to find it, please visit your router’s official website to find the manual or seek help from your ISP.
* **Update the game** , if you haven’t already.

 If none of the above helps, and you’re still seeing the error code 277 in Roblox, please move on.

## 4\. Run Roblox as admin

 Lacking certain system permissions or privileges could also be the reason why Roblox has error code 277\. To see if this is your case:

1. Right-click your **Roblox** **Player** icon and select **Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-17.png)
2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-18.png)

 Now open Roblox again (it should be opened with administrative permission), to see if error code 277 is st. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 5\. Try a different DNS server

 If you use your ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) default DNS server, you might encounter issues like a crowded cache, which could cause problems like error code 277 in Roblox. To see if this is an issue for you, you can first flush the DNS, and then switch to a public DNS server. To do so:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** , then press**Shift** and**Enter** at the same time. If prompted for permission, click**Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/run-cmd.png)
3. Copy**ipconfig /flushdns** , and paste it in the pop-up window. Then press**Enter** .

4. Your DNS cache is successfully cleared.

## 6\. Repair corrupted or damaged system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones.
