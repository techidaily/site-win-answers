 If**Updates are available** , click**Install now** and wait for the updates to be installed on your system. Once complete, restart your computer and relaunch your game. If it doesn’t have a huge impact, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is one of the core components of your computer. And your graphics driver is an essential piece of software that guarantees you can get the top performance from your graphics card. If it’s outdated, myriads of issues can be expected to occur. To mitigate the in-game stutters, you need to update your graphics driver.

 There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 First, you’ll need to know your graphics card’s name and its manufacturer.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **dxdiag**  and hit **Enter** to open the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dxdiag.jpg)
3. Select the**Display** tab. In the Device section, you’ll see your graphics card’s name and manufacturer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/graphics-card-name-and-manufacturer-new.jpg)

 Now go to the manufacturer’s official website of your graphics card. Find the most up-to-date driver for your system. Then all you need to do is follow the on-screen instructions to download and install it.

 Below are the driver download pages of the major graphics card manufacturers.

* [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
* [AMD](http://www.amd.com/drivers)
* [Intel](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time or patience to hunt for driver updates, you can instead use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a handy driver updater that can automatically help detect any outdated or missing drivers, download and install the correct drivers for your system.

 After updating drivers, restart your computer and check whether this has a blast on your performance. If that’s not your case, no worries! Below are some other methods you can try.

## 3\. Disable non-essential applications

 As you know, games are CPU intensive and graphically demanding. If you have too many applications running in the background while playing Modern Warfare 2, you definitely cannot get the optimum performance. To prevent them from eating up your system memory, you can temporarily disable them. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **taskmgr**  and hit Enter.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the **Processes**  tab, right-click on each of the applications you don’t necessarily use while playing the game and select**End task** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/end-task.png)

 Once you’re done, dive into a new gameplay. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Reset priority and affinity

 There’s another tweak that can be used when experiencing low FPS and stutters in Modern Warfare 2\. It’s that you adjust the task priority and reset the affinity. This trick has been upvoted by many players on Reddit and you should give it a shot. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Input**taskmgr** and hit Enter to open the Task Manager.
3. Select the**Details** tab. Find your game and your game launcher and select**Set priority > Low** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/change-priority-to-low.jpg)
4. Click**Change priority** to confirm the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/confirm-to-change-priority.jpg)

 For users who have a 6-12 core CPU, use the Task Manager and set affinity to CPU 0,1,2,3\. All you have to do is right-click your game and your game launcher, then select**Set affinity** . When the window opens, make sure**only the boxes next to CPU 0, CPU 1, CPU 2, CPU 3 are checked** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After you’ve applied all the changes, launch your game and see how things go. If no improvements have been seen, move on to the next fix.

## 5\. Enable hardware acceleration

 The next method you should try is to enable the hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, a feature that is designed to boost in-game FPS. If you have the latest Windows version, a Geforce 10 series or later/ Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card with the latest driver, you can enable this feature and see if you can notice a performance improvement. Below are the steps you can take to enable it.

 (Screenshots below come from Windows 10\. If you’re running Windows 11, your screen might look slightly different. )

1. In the search box, type **graphics settings** .
2. Toggle **on**  Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. Select **Desktop app**  from the drop-down. Then click on the **Browse**  button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dyling-Light-2-enable-accelerated-high-gpu-scheduling.png)
3. Then go to your game’s installation folder and add the exe file to the list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After applying the changes, launch the game and test the performance. If you can’t see many improvements, move on to the next method below.

## 6\. Verify your game files

 From time to time, your game files might get corrupted and some essential files even go missing out of nowhere. When that happens, various issues would occur, ranging from minor game glitches to critical issues. To check if that’s your case, you can utilize the repair tool.

* [Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Battle.net](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### On Steam

1. Open your Steam client. Under **LIBRARY** , right-click the game title and select **Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-properties-steam.png)
2. Choose the **LOCAL FILES**  tab. Then click on the **Verify integrity of game files…**  button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-II-verify-game-files.png)

 Steam is now verifying the integrity of your game files. This process could take several minutes depending on the file size.

 Once the repair is finished, close the window and play your game to check if it works. If this doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the[next fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### On Battle.net

1. Open the Battle.net desktop app.
2. Click on the game icon.
3. Click on the cogwheel next to the **Play** button and select **Scan and Repair** .
4. Wait for the repair to finish.

If that doesn’t make any difference, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 7\. Tweak in-game settings

 Sometimes, the settings by default may not be tailored to your rigs. You can adjust them and check if that can give you a performance boost. Simply open your game settings and make the following adjustments.

* Under the DISPLAY section

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tweak-in-game-settings.jpg)

* Under the QUALITY section

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/modern-warfare-2-quality-settings.jpg)

## 8\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If none of the methods listed above work, it’s time to check if you have corrupt system files, which are notorious for making your PC error-prone. In addition, your PC performance is negatively affected. To prevent this from happening, you should run a scan of your system files. If necessary, you’ll need to repair those corrupted files. For that work, the System File Checker tool may help. You can run the sfc /scannow command hopefully to help identify the problems and repair missing or corrupted system files. However, failures could happen.

 In this situation, you’ll need a more powerful tool to find the culprit. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is such a tool that specializes in Windows repair. It’ll detect different kinds of issues on your PC’s Operating System, and remove and replace damaged files found.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
