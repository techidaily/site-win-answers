## Fix 2: Uninstall incompatible app

 Make sure thereâ€™s no other software working on the background. Itâ€™s possible that some apps are incompatible with Steam which cause the sound issue. Some players figured out when they had Sonic Studio on, thereâ€™s an audio mixer or no sound. After installing the software, the Dying Light was working perfectly.
