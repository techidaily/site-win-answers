## Fix 1: Change language on Steam

 This fix should resolve the issue with the missing voiceovers. Follow the guide and youâ€™ll get back the audio.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Go to the Steam**Library.**
3. Right-click Dying Light and select**Properties** .
4. Choose Language, then change the language to English and close the tab.
5. Repeat the process, but this time pick your language.

 If youâ€™re already in English, try another language to see if the voices are in this language, then turn back to English.

## Fix 2: Uninstall incompatible app

 Make sure thereâ€™s no other software working on the background. Itâ€™s possible that some apps are incompatible with Steam which cause the sound issue. Some players figured out when they had Sonic Studio on, thereâ€™s an audio mixer or no sound. After installing the software, the Dying Light was working perfectly.

## Fix 3: Update your driver

 Sound issue often relates to your sound card and the audio driver. If your audio driver is outdated or wrongly installed, you may encounter sound issues.

 Thereâ€™re two ways to update your driver, manually and automatically.  
 You can updating drivers by going to the manufacturerâ€™s official website, then download and install the latest driver which compatible with your operating system.
