## Speedy Success: Navigating the Nuances of Star Wars BF2 Shader Improvement

Star Wars Battlefront 2 is free on Epic Games! But a recent issue that‚Äôs coming up in forums is that they are stuck while trying to start the game on the ‚ÄúOptimizing Shaders‚Äù screen. This happens after the most recent patches. It simply gets stuck somewhere along the progress bar or it takes infinitely long to finish. Here we got a quick fix to resolve the issue. That is to**disable the DirectX 12** .

 Once you‚Äôve done these, launch your game. This time, while loading into the game, you‚Äôll notice that it simply skips the shaders‚Äô installation completely. This means that you should be able to play the game without any issues.

 After you successfully launched the game, it may re-enable the DirectX 12 mode automatically or it won‚Äôt. If it won‚Äôt, you can manually re-enable it.

## Re-enable DirectX 12 mode

 1) Go to the game‚Äôs main menu and head across to the**OPTIONS** screen. Then select**VIDEO** .

## Why disabling DirectX 12 works

 It‚Äôs possible that DirectX 12 could offer some enhancements for your machine, using DirectX 11 should allow the software to run much more reliably and stably. Basically, while the game is running in DirectX 12 mode, it‚Äôs able to pre-cache certain shaders so that you can get much better performance in-game. But chances are, the game might not be launching as expected.

 In conclusion, disabling the DirectX 12 may cost you certain visual aesthetics, but nothing substantial. And at least this is the quickest way to get into the game and it‚Äôs easy to re-enable it.
