## Why disabling DirectX 12 works

 It‚Äôs possible that DirectX 12 could offer some enhancements for your machine, using DirectX 11 should allow the software to run much more reliably and stably. Basically, while the game is running in DirectX 12 mode, it‚Äôs able to pre-cache certain shaders so that you can get much better performance in-game. But chances are, the game might not be launching as expected.

 In conclusion, disabling the DirectX 12 may cost you certain visual aesthetics, but nothing substantial. And at least this is the quickest way to get into the game and it‚Äôs easy to re-enable it.
