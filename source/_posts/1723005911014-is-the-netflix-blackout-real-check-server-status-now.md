## How to check Netflix status

 To check whether it‚Äôs downtime for Netflix, one surefire way is to go to[**Netflix Help Center**](https://help.netflix.com/en/is-netflix-down) .

 While you‚Äôre in[**Netflix Help Center**](https://help.netflix.com/en/is-netflix-down) ,

* If you see**a triangle with an exclamation mark** and ‚Äú **We are currently experiencing issues streaming on all devices** ‚Äú, it means the Netflix server is down. Good news is you don‚Äôt have to troubleshoot the problem for yourself. But bad news is there is nothing you can do but sit around and wait till the service is fully functional again.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dd.png)
