## Is the Netflix Blackout Real? Check Server Status Now

If you’re going to get your weekly dose of Netflix, but instead of being able to binge it all the way you want, you’re greeted with one of the following dreaded errors:

* Netflix Site Error. We were unable to process your request;
* Sorry, we are unable to reach the Netflix service;
* Cannot Connect to Netflix;
* Cannot reach Netflix.com;
* Netflix is Not Available;
* Netflix is Unavailable;
* Unable to Connect to Netflix;
* Android Error: Connection Failed

 you’re probably not just facing it alone. In this article, you’ll learn how to**check if Netflix is down or up** and **fixes for you to troubleshoot if it’s not a server problem** . Please read on. 😉

## How to check Netflix status

 To check whether it’s downtime for Netflix, one surefire way is to go to[**Netflix Help Center**](https://help.netflix.com/en/is-netflix-down) .

 While you’re in[**Netflix Help Center**](https://help.netflix.com/en/is-netflix-down) ,

* If you see**a triangle with an exclamation mark** and “ **We are currently experiencing issues streaming on all devices** “, it means the Netflix server is down. Good news is you don’t have to troubleshoot the problem for yourself. But bad news is there is nothing you can do but sit around and wait till the service is fully functional again.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dd.png)
* if you see**the big tick icon** and the “**Netflix is up** !” message, it means that the service is currently up and running.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-301.png)

 This time the server should not be the culprit of the Netflix not working issue on your device. You can search its**Help Center** for possible fixes for the problem you’re having. Or, you can read on to see if you can fix the problem by yourself.
