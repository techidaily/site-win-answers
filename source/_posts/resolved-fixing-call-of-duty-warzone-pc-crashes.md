### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Make sure you have the latest driver for your graphic card. If you don’t have the latest graphics driver, then it can cause lots of problems. With outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter game issues including crashing, stuttering, lagging, and more.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

**Option 1 – Manually** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers. Go to the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Search for your GPU model to download and install. Make sure the driver is compatible with your operating system.

OR

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

2. Rename the**Modern Warfare** file to**.85** .
3. Run Battle.net.
4. Click the**gear** button and click**Scan and Repair** .
