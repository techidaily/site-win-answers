### Fix 1 – Disable peripherals

 According to some players, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands crashes when they have a controller connected. While peripherals can add more fun to games, they might trigger compatibility issues with new titles. So if you’re using any peripherals like   **a wheel, controller, other USB devices or even the second monitor** , simply unplug them and see how thing goes. If the problem persists, check out more solutions below.

### Fix 2 – Run the game on DX11

 The game launches in DX12 by default. But if you receive a specific error saying DX12 is not supported, you should force the DX11 mode. This may eliminate the crashes and make your game more stable at a lower performance.

1. Launch Epic Games launcher and navigate to the**Settings** tab.
2. Scroll down to the bottom and expand Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands under Manage Games.
3. Check**Additional Command Line Arguments** and enter**\-dx11** in the field.

 Now see if you can play the game smoothly. If not, move forward to the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphics driver is one of the most common causes of game crashes. Although Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands doesn’t require demanding hardware, you still need to make sure your device drivers, especially the GPU driver, are already up-to-date for the best game performance.

 Major GPU manufacturers constantly roll out new drivers to provide performance improvements. You can visit their websites, **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , to download the latest graphics driver and install them manually.

 If you don’t have the time or patience to update the graphics driver manually, **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will do this automatically for you. Driver Easy will recognize your system and find all the most recent and correct drivers for it. You don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver or worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  

 If you’re not ready to pay, you can click the**Update** button next to the flagged GPU driver to download the correct version of that driver, then you’ll need to install it manually.

 See if a driver update gives you luck. If the game is still crashing, try the next method.

### Fix 4 – Verify integrity of game files

 Missing or damaged game file is another known culprit of game issues or errors. To see if that’s the reason for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands crashing, you could use the built-in tool of your game launcher to identify and repair the faulty files easily.

1. Open the Epic Games Launcher and navigate to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/verify-game-files-2.jpg)
2. Locate Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. Click the**three-dot icon** and select**Verify** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 It will take a while for the process to complete. Once done, restart the game to see how it works. If it keeps crashing, there’s the last fix to try.

### Fix 5 – Stop overclocking

 Overclocking your CPU and GPU can give you a significant performance boost, but it can possibly lead to instability issues like a game crash. To rule out this cause, you should just**turn off all the overclocking utilities** and**reset your processor to the default** . If doing this alone doesn’t stop the crashes, try deleting certain game files. This is an effective workaround for Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands not launching or crashing at startup. Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command.
2. Type**%localappdata%\\Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands\\Saved** and click**OK** .
