## Fix 1: Optimize network for speed

 “Optimize Network for Speed” is an in-game feature that you can choose whether to enable or not. If you’ve already enabled this feature and are still having latency issues, then you should disable it and see if that makes a difference; if you haven’t turned it on, then try enabling it instead.

 1) Click the**Esc** key on your keyboard while WoW is open.

 2) Select**System** in the pop-up menu.

 3) On the**Network** tab, check/uncheck the**Optimize Network for Speed** option based on your situation.

 That’s it! Now you should check to see whether you’re still experiencing lag issues in WoW. If the problems persist, then move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Use “flushdns” command

 This command is pretty useful to solve network-related issues. When you’re having major lag spikes in games or just feel that your network connection is unstable/stops working, you should always give this fix a try.

 1) On your taskbar, type **command** into the search box. Then right-click on the **Command Prompt** result and select **Run as administrator** .

 Click **Yes** if you’re prompted about permission.

2) In your command prompt window, enter the following command:

ipconfig /release

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the release process is complete.

3) Then type the following command:

ipconfig /renew

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the renewal process is complete.

4) This time, enter:

ipconfig /flushdns

**Note** that there’s a space between “ipconfig” and “/”.

 Press **Enter** on your keyboard and wait till the process is complete.

 Exit the Command Prompt window. Now check to see if your WoW is still laggy. If it is, proceed to Fix 3.

## Fix 3: Update device drivers

 As reported by many players, their ping times in WoW have gone back to normal after they updated the device drivers. If you’re not sure whether all your device drivers (especially network card drivers) are up-to-date, you should check.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, one device at a time. But this takes a lot of time and patience, and if any of your drivers do happen to be out of date, you’ll need to manually update them, which is difficult and risky. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, **you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-439.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**Note:** If you want to restore your DNS server addresses, simply change “Use the following DNS server addresses” to **“** Obtain DNS server address automatically” and then restart your network adapter.

 7) Reboot your PC and start WoW. Check your ping times in the game and see whether the problem has been solved.

If this fix didn’t help, read on and try the next one.

## Fix 5: Close bandwidth-hogging apps

 Bandwidth hogging applications will slow down your network speed and trigger latency issues in WoW. Make sure you shut down all the resource-hungry programs before playing the game. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **resmon** and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-613.png)

 2) In the **Resource Monitor** window, on the **Network** tab, take note of the **Total (B/sec)** column. In this way, you’ll get an intuitive understanding of what process is now using the most of your bandwidth.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-620.png)

 3) **Right-click** on the application that’s eating up your bandwidth and select **End Process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-621.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) When Windows asks you to confirm, click **End process** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-622.png)

**Note:** Make sure you know what sort of applications you’re closing. **DO NOT** stop any programs that you’re not familiar with in case you mistakenly end the crucial ones (often related to your system) such as sychost.exe.

 5) Your trouble is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the high ping issue reoccurs.

 If you no longer have huge lag spikes in WoW after you disable the antivirus, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

**Note:** Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 If you find no luck getting closer to the real solution, you should take a stab at Fix 6.

## Fix 6: Restart your router & modem

 You should restart your modem and router especially if they haven’t been switched off for a long time. Just give them some time to cool off and clear up the cache. Here’s how to do it:

1) Unplug both your router and modem.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-597.png)

modem

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

wireless router

2) Wait at least 30 seconds to let the two machines cool down a bit.

3) Plug the modem back in and wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

4) Plug the router back in this time. Likewise, wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.

5) Now that your routers and modem have been restarted properly, you can launch WoW again to see if the high ping issue goes away.

 In case this fix is to little or no avail, read on and check out the next one.

## Fix 7: Swap Wifi to Ethernet connection

 If none of the fixes above work out for you, then maybe you should shift your focus to the Wi-Fi signals around (only if you’re a Wi-Fi user). Admittedly, a wireless network is not as stable as a wired one so you’ll get more interruptions for having your computer connected to Wi-Fi. Say, when you’re playing WoW in a room far away from your router, the Wi-Fi signals you receive can be rather weak and hence the reason for high ping.

 To clear up this problem, you should swap Wi-Fi to an Ethernet connection but this is not practical for everyone. Alternatively, you can try using a **[powerline Ethernet adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Powerline-ethernet-Adapter-TL-PA4010KIT/dp/B00AWRUICG/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=1AQS3BNGEZITB&keywords=powerline+ethernet+adapter&qid=1558322595&s=gateway&sprefix=power+line%2Caps%2C338&sr=8-3&tag=drivereasycom-20)**  which extends the reach of your home network to places with poor wireless coverage.

 Also, you should avoid possible wireless interference that weakens your Wi-Fi signals such as cordless phones and microwave ovens. Place them far away from your router, or simply move your laptop to a new location with stronger Wi-Fi signals.
