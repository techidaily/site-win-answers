## Cyberpunk 2077 Overcoming Freeze-Up: Solutions & Fixes

Finally, Cyberpunk 2077 is released! But it could be very frustrating to encounter the freezing issue when you’re playing the game.

 Although it’s hard to detect the cause of the issue because of the different hardware and software settings, there are a few fixes you can try.

 Before trying these fixes, make sure your computer has met[the minimum requirements](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[End unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Adjust your virtual memory](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall your game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is one of the most important components in gaming performance, especially for AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077\. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-57-32.jpg)
3. Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time while gaming, that could cause your PC to overload and make your game freeze.

 Simply close all the unnecessary programs and run Cyberpunk 2077 again, check if it’s the cause of the freezing issue.

1. Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-03-45.jpg)
2. Right-click the programs you want to close and select **End Task** . Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-07-59.jpg)
3. Restart Cyberpunk 2077 to see if this fixed your issue.

 If this fix doesn’t help your case, simply take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: Verify your game files

 This issue might happen when Cyberpunk 2077 files on your PC are corrupt or missing. If you’re playing the game on Steam, follow the instructions below to verify your game files:

1. Run Steam.
2. Click **LIBRARY** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-27_15-04-01.jpg)
3. Right-click **Cyberpunk 2077**  and select **Properties** .
4. Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** . This could take several minutes. Wait for the process to be complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/verify-integrity-of-game-files-Steam-1.jpg)
5. Relaunch Cyberpunk 2077 to check the issue.

 If your game still won’t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory**  is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running Cyberpunk 2077, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you don’t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If that’s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-41.jpg)
2. Click **Settings** .

3. Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-31.jpg)
4. Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-27-1.jpg)
5. Click your **C drive** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-18-22.jpg)
6. Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

You can follow these simple steps to do a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  (the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **msconfig**  and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box before **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA**  and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/msconfig-uncheck-services-clean-boot.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.
