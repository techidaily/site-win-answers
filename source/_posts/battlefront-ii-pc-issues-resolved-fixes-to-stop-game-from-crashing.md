## How to Prevent NieR: Réplicant From Crashing - Issue Resolved

NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is finally online! But did you manage to play it? It could be annoying to have the game crash on startup. Don’t worry, this post could help.

## Check your specs

Make sure your PC meets the minimum requirement of NieR Replicant.

| OS        | Windows 10 64-bit                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Processor | AMD Ryzen™ 3 1300X; Intel® Core™ i5-6400     |
| Memory    | 8 GB Ram                                     |
| Graphics  | AMD Radeon R9 270X or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 |
| Storage   | 42 GB available space                        |

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Edit username](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Disable your antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Edit username

 It may sound ridiculous, but some players have reported that their usernames are solely composed of characters in your platform’s text language can fix the NieR Replicant crash at startup.

 That means, if your platform language is English, you can’t use not-standard-English characters in your username. After removing these marks or characters, the problem is solved.

If this fix doesn’t work, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Run as administrator

 Lack of administrative rights can also be the reason for Nier Replicant crashing issue.

### Fix 4: Update your drivers

 One of the most common causes of games crashing is you’re using outdated or corrupted drivers. You need to make sure your drivers are fully up-to-date so that you’re able to enjoy one of the best AAA titles in 2021.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)

### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus software
