### Key Takeaways

 To export a cell range as a PDF, first select the range with your cursor or using keyboard shortcuts. Select File > Export > Create PDF/XPS Document. On Windows, click the "Options" button and choose "Selection" or "Entire Workbook" under "Publish What." On a Mac, these options are displayed at the bottom of the save dialog.

The result is a super handy document you can share any way you want.

 If you have a particular cell range you want to [export to a PDF](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-eliminating-exposure-how-to-conceal-private-video-sections-for-2024/), you can do this in just a few steps.

 Select the cells you want to export. You can do this by dragging your cursor through adjacent cells or holding Ctrl as you select non-adjacent cells.

 Keep in mind that if you choose non-adjacent cells, they may display on separate pages in the PDF document.

##  Export an Excel Workbook as a PDF on Windows

 Maybe you want to export the entire workbook as a PDF file. You can do this by following the same basic steps as above for exporting a cell range.

 Before you begin, keep in mind that you won't have an option to select the page breaks ahead of time. By default, sheets with a lot of data carry over to the other pages. If you want one sheet per page, take a look at our how-to for [inserting page breaks in Excel](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-advanced-techniques-in-xbox-gaming-recording-setup/) first.

 When you're ready to export your Excel workbook, go to the File tab and select "Export" on the left. On the right, pick "Create PDF/XPS Document" and click the Create PDF/XPS button.

 Choose a file location, optionally adjust the file name, and confirm that PDF is selected in the Save as Type drop-down box. Then, select "Options."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Below Publish What, pick "Entire Workbook." To ignore any [print areas](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-insights-into-magix-video-pro-xs-design/) you've set up in the workbook, be sure to check that box in the same section. You can then use the Page Range and other areas and options as needed.

![Publish Options window to pick Entire Workbook](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OptionsWorkbook-ExcelExportCellsWorkbookPDF.png) 

 Click "OK" in the Options window and "Publish" in the Publish as PDF or XPS window. Then, visit the location where you saved the PDF file to open it.

##  Save Excel to a PDF on Mac

 Like on Windows, you can turn a selection of cells or a workbook into a PDF on Mac. The steps are slightly different from those above.

 When you open the workbook, choose a sheet and select the cells if you want to export a cell range. To save the entire workbook as a PDF, simply open it.

 Select File > Save As in the menu bar. When the window appears, choose a location and optionally adjust the filename. Then, select "PDF" in the File Format drop-down box.

 To export the cell range, choose "Selection" which displays the selected cells for you to confirm. To export the entire workbook, choose "Workbook."

![Workbook and Selection options for a PDF from Excel on Mac](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SelectionWorkbookPDFMac-ExcelExportCellsWorkbookPDF-1.png) 

 Select "Save" when you finish, and then head to your chosen location to access the PDF.

 Whether you want to share part of your Excel sheet or back up a specific version of a workbook, exporting it to a PDF file is a solid option.
