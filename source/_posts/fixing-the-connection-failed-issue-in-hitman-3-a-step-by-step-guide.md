## Hitman 3 and the Infamous Connection Failure Problem - Solutions Inside

Many players are reporting that Hitman 3 is having server issues, and they constantly get the “**Connection Failed** ” error message.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/connection-failed-1200x675.png)

 “Unable to connect to the hitman service. Failed to fetch downloadable content information from the hitman server. For more information, contact hitman support.”

 If you’re experiencing the same issue and hitting the “Retry” button didn’t work, you may want to try the following fixes, which have helped many other players.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Reboot your network](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Allow Hitman 3 to run through Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your network driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Run your game as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Flush your DNS and Renew your IP](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Reboot your network

 Before you try any of the fixes below, you may want to simply restart your game and router. If restarting the game multiple times failed to launch the game, you’ll need to restart your network:

1. **Turn off everything** that is connected to the network.
2. Unplug your**router first** and your**modem second** . Things could be much easier if you have a[router with a built-in modem](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-C7000-Compatible-Providers-including/dp/B0781Z5PCL/?tag=drivereasycom-20) .
3. Wait**at least 10 seconds** .
4. Plug your**modem back in first** and your**router second** .
5. Grab yourself a cup of coffee, for this may take 2 to 3 minutes for your modem and router to fully boot up.
6. Turn on your computer and connect to the Internet.
7. Launch your game again and see if Hitman 3 works properly now.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Allow Hitman 3 to run through Windows Firewall

 The**Connection Failed** error can happen if Windows Firewall is blocking your game. So be sure to check the Windows Firewall settings and let your Hitman 3 run through Windows Firewall. Here is how:

1. In the Windows Search bar, type**firewall** and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![Windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Windows-firewall.jpg)
2. On the left pane, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/allow-app.jpg)
3. Make sure your Hitman 3 is on the list, and also make sure it’s ticked for**Private** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/change-settings.jpg)
5. Click**Allow another app…**  
![change settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/allow-another-app.jpg)
6. Add your Hitman 3 executable file. If you’re not sure where the game is installed, please follow these steps:  
   * Click on the game title in your library.  
   * Select _**Properties**_ from the menu on the left.  
   * In the _**Local files**_ section, press _**Open folder**_ .  
   ![open hitman 3 folder](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Open-folders.png)
7. Now launch your game again and test if the**Hitman 3 connection failed error** has been solved.

## Fix 3: Update your network driver

 The thing is when you click**Play** or**Retry** , your network adapter driver will be disabled instantly, thus causing you to get stuck in the world of disconnection. To fix this, you can try updating your network driver to resolve this issue.

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to a flagged network adapter driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-network-adapter-driver.jpg)  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

## Fix 4: Run your game as an administrator

 This might be triggered by limited administrative rights. So to make sure you can access all the game files, you can run Hitman 3 and Epic Games Launcher as administrators. Here’s how to run it as admin permanently:

1. Right-click your Hitman 3 executable file (and game launcher), and select**Properties** .
2. Select the tab **Compatibility** and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK** .  
![run as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/run-as-admin.jpg)
3. Next time you open your game launcher, it will launch in admin mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Disable antivirus software

 Some antivirus software may block some features in Hitman 3 so that you can encounter the “**connection failed** ” error. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

 For some antivirus software, disabling them might not work. You can temporally uninstall it or add Hitman 3 to their exclusion lists.

**Note:** Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

## Fix 6:**Flush your DNS and Renew your IP**

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **cmd**  and then press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Enter**  on your keyboard at the same time to run the Command Prompt as administrator.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Snap8-5.jpg)
3. You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to run the **Command Prompt** .
4. Type the command line **ipconfig /flushdns**  and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

5. Then type the command line **ipconfig /release**  and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.
