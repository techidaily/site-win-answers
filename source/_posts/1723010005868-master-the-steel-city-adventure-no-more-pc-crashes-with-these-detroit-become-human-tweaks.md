### Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience.

 If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may run into Ghost Recon Breakpoint crash issue.

 **To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver.** There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.
