### Fix 4: Try another network / reboot your network

 The Origin won’t load issue can also be a network issue. Try another network or reboot your network to see if Origin will load. By rebooting your network, your Internet connection may be back to normal.

**To reboot your network:**

1. **Unplug** your modem (and your wireless router, if it’s a separate device) from power for **60 seconds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/modem-1.jpg) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wireless-router-1.jpg)
2. **Plug in** your network devices again and wait until the indicator lights are back to its normal state.
3. Try launching Origin again.

 See if Origin will load. If not, try the next fix to add Origin as an exception to your third party antivirus application.

---

### Fix 5: **Add Origin as an exception to your third party antivirus application**

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Origin.

 Since Origin consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and Origin may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Origin as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 If this fix still doesn’t work for you, try the next fix below to check if this is a server issue.

### Fix 6: Check if this is a server issue

 If this is a server issue, there is little we can do to fix this issue. You can go to its official forum or Reddit, or Twitter to check if the Origin server is down.
