### Fix 1 – Unplug peripherals

 If you have a gamepad or controller connected to the computer, it’s likely they’ve interfered with Diablo Immortal and triggered the crash. You could simply **unplug those peripherals like the wheel, controller or other USB devices** to see if the problem gets fixed. If not, check out the next solution.

### Fix 2 – Launch the game in windowed mode

 There are increasing reports about Diablo Immortal crashing in fullscreen. To avoid it crashing on startup, you can force the game to launch in windowed mode. Here’s how:

1. Launch the**Battle.net** launcher and select**Diablo Immortal** from the top pane.

### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card driver is very essential for gaming performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you may suffer from various performance issues of Diablo Immortal including game crashes, low FPS and stuttering. And you should update the graphics driver for maximum gameplay.

 Major GPU manufacturers frequently release new graphics drivers which will give performance improvements, particularly for newer games. Simply go to their official websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system and download it manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct GPU drivers for your Windows version. And it only takes two steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).
