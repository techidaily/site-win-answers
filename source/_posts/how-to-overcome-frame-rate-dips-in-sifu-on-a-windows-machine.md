 Sometimes iTunes won’t find your phone when there’re other conflicting accessories. In this case, you can try to**remove all USB accessories except for your device** .

3. Now try to reconnect your iPhone.

If it’s not tethering in your case, simply check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Make sure your drivers are up to date

 One of the most common causes of this issue is that you’re using**broken or outdated computer drivers** . A large number of users reported that iTunes works after a driver update. So before you attempt anything more complicated, definitely**make sure you’re using the latest drivers** .

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your drivers: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to update your driver manually. To do so, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s website and search for your model. Then go to the download/support page and get the latest installers that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/update-all.jpg)

 Once you’ve updated all your drivers, restart your PC and check if iTunes is working now.

 If the latest drivers don’t do the charm for you, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Try other versions of iTunes

 iTunes has never worked perfectly on Windows, and sometimes the not recognizing iPhone problem is limited to a buggy version. You can try to**uninstall iTunes completely and test other versions** .

You can use the following steps to remove iTunes completely.

#### Uninstall iTunes completely

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to open the Run box. Type or paste**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .

**Apple Application Support 32-bit**  
**Apple Application Support 64-bit**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uninstall-itunes-0.jpg)

 After you uninstall a component, you might be prompted to restart your computer. Don’t reboot until you’ve finished removing all of the components.

Then you need to remove the remaining files:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run dialog. Type or paste**%programfiles%** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/programfiles.jpg)

4. Delete the following folders if exist:  
 **Mobile Device Support**  
 **Apple Application Support**

 Now you need to download and install other versions of iTunes. Note that you shouldn’t choose ancient builds as they might not support new products.

 For history iTunes versions, see[this wiki](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/ITunes) . You can also check out the[Microsoft Store version](https://apple.co/ms) .

<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once completed, restart your PC for the changes to take effect. Then test if iTunes detects your iPhone now.

If the issue lingers on, try the next solution below.

### Fix 6: Try your iPhone on another PC

 In some cases, it could be your phone that’s causing all the hassle. You can**try connecting your iPhone to another computer** to find out what went wrong exactly.

 If the issue doesn’t appear on other PCs, it could mean that it’s a computer error. The most nuclear solution will be reinstalling your Windows system.

 If the issue reappears, you might need to reset your iPhone or contact Apple Support for further assistance.
