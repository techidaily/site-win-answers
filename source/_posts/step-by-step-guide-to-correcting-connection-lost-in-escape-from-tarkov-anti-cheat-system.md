9. **[Reinstall Valorant](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Change your computer resolution

 Manufacturers will**stop updating drivers** for some GPUs after a period of time, that way they can phase out outdated graphics cards. Therefore some graphics cards might not have decent support for high resolution gaming.

 If you’re using an old graphics card, you should try**switching to a lower computer resolution** . Here’s how to do that:

1. **Right click** on the empty area of your desktop, then select **Display settings.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_14-42-27.jpg)
2. Under the**Scale and layout** section, select an option from the drop down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_14-47-42.jpg)
3. Choose a**lower** resolution.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_14-51-18.jpg)

 You can test all the resolution options with Valorant and see which one solve your problem. If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry, just try the next one.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 This issue can be caused by**buggy or outdated graphics drivers** . Some players reported that Valorant won’t launch because their graphics drivers were little out of date. So before trying anything more complicated, first**make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver** .

 One option is to update manually: You can visit the manufacturer website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the video driver. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver,**launch Valorant** and see if the issue persists.

If this trick doesn’t work for you, simply try the next one.

## Fix 3: Run Valorant in compatible mode

 Some Windows updates may conflict with Valorant. If that’s the case, you can try to**launch Valorant in compatible mode** . Here’re the steps:

1. On your desktop,**right click** the Valorant icon and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_16-16-07-1.jpg)
2. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Under**Compatibility mode** section,**check** the box before**Run this program in compatibility mode for** . If you’re on Windows 10, set it to**Windows 8** . If you’re on Windows 8, set it to Windows 7\. Click**OK** to finish.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_16-21-11.jpg)
3. **Restart** your computer and**launch Valorant** .

 If this solve your problem, congratulations! If not, you can move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Run Valorant as an Administrator

 By default, Windows executes a program as a regular user, which has limited access to some directories.**Running Valorant as an Administrator** avoids the permission issue. To do so, simply follow these steps:

1. On your desktop,**right click** the Valorant icon and select**Run as administrator** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-10_9-53-24-1.jpg)  
**If you can launch the game this way** , continue to the next step to set Valorant to always run in administrator mode.**If the problem persists** , please jump to the next method.
2. On your desktop,**right click** the Valorant icon and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_16-16-07-1.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Under**Settings** section,**check** the box before**Run this program as an Administrator** . Click**OK** to finish.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_16-44-49-1.jpg)
4. Launch Valorant and see if you can log in.

## Fix 5: Close all Riot related processes

 Some players commented that Valorant won’t start when a process is not working properly. That means you need to exit all the Riot related processes and launch Valorant again. Here’re 3 things you need to do:

1. **Right click** Task Bar to open**task manager** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605" border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_16-58-59.jpg)
2. **Scroll through** all the processes and search for Riot related processes (**Those with a Riot or Valorant logo** ). If you find any, select them and click**End task** to stop them.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_17-17-24.jpg)  
 (Note you**should not** **stop** the**Vanguard** process. Otherwise you’ll have to restart your computer before launching Valorant again.)
3. When you’ve exited all the riot related processes,**launch Valorant** and see if you’re still have errors.

 If this fix doesn’t work for you, there’s still a last fix you can try.

## Fix 6: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 If you’re seeing an error telling you Valorant is “**unable to start correctly (0xc000005)** ” or “**couldn’t install a required dependency** “, then maybe it’s your antivirus that’s triggering the issue. In this case, you can try disabling it and see how things go.

Here’s an example of how to disable Windows Security:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the I key) to open Windows Settings. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)

 Recently we received reports of a Valorant startup error that reads “**This game is not available on your operating system** “. This error doesn’t seem to be system-related, since players are getting it even on Windows 10\. If you’re seeing this error, there’s one fix you can try before reinstalling.

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** to open**Task Manager** . Then right-click**VALORANT** and select**End task** .

2. Press**Win+R** to invoke the Run box, then type or paste**%localappdata%\\VALORANT\\Saved** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/valorant-purge-config-1.jpg)
3. Delete all the files in the**Config** and**Logs** folder. Then restart your PC and check if Valorant launches now.

## Fix 8: Release Standby Memory

 One common reason Valorant won’t launch is that your PC doesn’t have the available RAM for the game. Windows uses part of the physical RAM as cache, or what is called**Standby Memory** . The system might run into issues when standby memory isn’t released on time. In that case, you can clear the standby memory manually and see how it goes.

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** together to open**Task Manager** . Navigate to the**Performance** tab, click**Open Resource Monitor** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. In Resource Monitor, navigate to the**Memory** tab. In the**Physical Memory** section, you’ll see the current memory usage. Check if**Standby Memory** is taking up too much of your total RAM.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/task-manager-resources-monitor-2.jpg)
3. You can empty the standby memory manually.  
 First, download[**EmptyStandbyList**](https://wj32.org/wp/software/empty-standby-list) . This is a command line tool that can help you empty standby memory.
4. Once downloaded, right click the**EmptyStandbyList** program and select**Run as an Administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/emptystandbylist.jpg)
5. Go back to**Resource Monitor** and check if the standby memory has been cleared. Then you can check if the issue persists.

**(Optional)** You can also use**Task Scheduler** to clear the standby memory automatically. Theoretically, you can achieve the same result with a reboot, but it’ll be a different story while you’re in the middle of the game.

1. Right click**EmptySandbyList.exe** and select**Property** .
