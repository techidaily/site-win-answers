## 1\. Allow your game through Windows Firewall

 Players can’t launch Elden Ring if it fails to access the Internet. To make sure there is no interruption, you should manually allow Elden Ring to bypass the firewall.

1. In the Search box, type **windows firewall** and click **Windows Defender Firewall**  from the results.  

![Windows Defender Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows-firewall-1.jpg)
2. From the left panel, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  

![allow an app through windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-an-app-through-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)
3. Now you need to scroll down until you can find Elden Ring. If your game isn’t on the list, click on **Change settings > Allow another app…** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Your File Explorer is now opening. Then you can navigate to the game’s installation folder and add it to the list. Then **check the boxes under the Domain, Private and Public tabs** , and click **OK** to save the settings.

Now see if you could start the game. If not, try the next method.

## 2\. Close non-essential programs

 When you have too many programs running in the background, especially those memory-hogging programs, it can eat up the system resources. And therefore it makes your Elden Ring not launching or opening. To solve this, shut down those non-essential programs before you launch Elden Ring on Steam.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key + R**  at the same time to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **taskmgr**  and press **Enter** .  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Under the **Processes**  tab, select the program and click **End task** until you close all the unneeded applications.

 Then restart your game launcher. If it’s still not working, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When your game fails to launch properly, it’s high time you check whether your graphics driver is misconfigured or outdated. It’s worth mentioned that NVIDIA has released the**game ready driver** for Elden Ring to give players a performance boost. And AMD is also expected to release a new driver with optimized Elden Ring support. To get the latest driver, you can go to the manufacturer’s download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and follow the on-screen instructions to manually download and install the correct driver.

 Or you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 4\. Check for and install Windows updates

 Apart from keeping your drivers up to date, you should also update your Windows. Windows updates usually come with bug fixes (including fixes for compatibility issues) and bring new features. To diagnose your problem, you should check for and install Windows updates.

#### On Windows 10

1. In the Search box, type in **check for updates** . Click **Check for updates**  from results.  

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Click on the **Check for updates**  tab. If there are any updates available, it’ll automatically start to download and install it. Wait for the process to complete and you should be asked to restart your computer.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)

#### On Windows 11

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + I keys**  simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Click **Windows Update** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/check-windows-update.png)
3. Click **Check for updates** . Then Windows will start downloading the updates if they are available.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/check-for-updates.png)
4. When the process is complete, click **Restart now**  to restart your PC. Or you can **Schedule the restart** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/restart-after-windows-updates.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If installing Windows updates doesn’t seem to solve your issue, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Run your game as administrator

 Running a program as an administrator could be a simple workaround to resolve issues due to the lack of administrative rights. So you can give it a try and see if it does the trick.

1. First you’ll need to go to the game’s installation folder. Generally, you can find it at_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common_ \\ELDEN RING\\Game. If it’s not located in this directory, open your Steam client, right-click the game and select**Properties > Manage > Browse local files** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-browse-files.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Locate your game’s exe file. Right-click it and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Check**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-Elden-Ring-as-administrator.png)

 After applying the changes, try to relaunch your game and see how things go. If you still can’t play Elden Ring, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Verify integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files will prevent your game from launching properly. To see if that’s the case with your Elden Ring, you can verify the integrity of your game files.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.png)
2. Choose the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Then click on the**Verify integrity of game files…** button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-verify-integrity-of-game-file.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Steam will verify the game files. This process may take a few minutes.  
 (You may encounter file validation failures, which is normal. If that’s what’s happening to you, you can safely ignore this message. )  

 Once the process is complete, close the window.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Elden-Ring-completed-verifying-integrity-of-game-files.png)

If you still fail to launch Elden Ring, proceed to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Repair your system files

 Program issues such as failure to launch can occur when your operating system becomes corrupted. To diagnose the problem you’re having, you should run a full scan on your system.

 You can do it manually, for sure. But this could take hours and you might end up not solving your issues. In this case, you can use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a more powerful tool that scans your computer for invalid registry issues, fragmented files, and Windows tweaks.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
