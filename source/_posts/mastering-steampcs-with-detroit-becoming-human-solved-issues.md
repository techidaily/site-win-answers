 1) Go to the official[Adobe Flash Player download website](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/) .

 2) Click**Install now**  . The .exe installation file would then be downloaded automatically. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b962aea31d8c.jpg)

### Fix 2: Disable hardware acceleration

 If you’re watching YouTube videos on your browser, we recommend**disabling hardware acceleration** on the browser to fix YouTube stuttering problem. With hardware acceleration enabled, programs are able to use other hardware components on your system to perform tasks more efficiently. But sometimes, this may bring some problems, including your stuttering YouTube videos.

 Follow to disable hardware acceleration on your browser: (Here take Google Chrome as an example.)

 1) Go to**Settings** in the More options menu on Chrome.

 2) Click**Advanced** at the very bottom. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b962bcf12143.png)

 4) Relaunch Chrome and then re-play the YouTube video to see if it plays smoothly.

### Fix 3: Update your video driver

 YouTube stuttering could also be caused by**an old, corrupted or missing video driver** on your computer. So you can update your video driver to the latest version to solve the issue.

You can update your video driver either manually or automatically.

#### Manual video driver update

 You can update your video driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, like NVIDIA and AMD, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

#### Automatic video driver update

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b95d9711631c.jpg)

 3)Click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support** and a **30-day money back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
Note: You can do it   **for free**  if you like, but it’s partly manual.
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b95da089dde0.jpg)

 Restart your computer and re-play the YouTube to see if it plays smoothly.

### Fix 4: Clear your browsing data and update your browser

 If there’re**too many caches** taking your browser’s room, you may have the YouTube Stuttering problem. So we recommend clearing your browsing data and then update your browser to the latest version.

Here we take Chrome as an example to giving a step-by-step guide:

1) Open a new blank tab on Chrome.

2) Hold down the**Ctrl** and**Shift** keys together. Then press**Del** .

3) Click**Clear data** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b962f3a665d9.jpg)

4) Click the**More options**  icon on the top right of Chrome. Select **Help** , then click **About Chrome** .

### Fix 5: Check your network connection

 If there’s any problem of your network connection, such as running slow, YouTube video may also stutter.

Here are some tips you can try for this case:

 Option 1: **Stop other programs that are eating up Internet usage and taking up your system space**  while you’re watching YouTube videos. Also, on your browser, **close all the other web tabs**  you don’t need at the time you’re watching the video.

 Option 2:**Update your network card driver**  to boost your Internet speed. Like updating your video driver shown in Fix 3, you can also update your network card driver either manually or automatically through **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
