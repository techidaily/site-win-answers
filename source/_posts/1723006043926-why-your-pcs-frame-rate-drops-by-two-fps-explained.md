## Install the latest game patch

 The developers of F1 2021 release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch F1 2021 to see if the FPS is back to normal. If the in-game FPS still drops, or there are no new game patches available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver, because outdated or faulty graphics drivers may be causing the F1 2021 FPS dropping issue.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click _Update All_ .)
4. Once the driver is updated, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

## Set the Power Plan of your PC for high performance

 In Windows 10, you can customize the power plan on your PC. In most cases, the power plan on PCs are configured to **Balanced** by default, which may limit the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 If you’re experiencing performance issues like FPS dropping, try modifying the Power Plan of your PC for the Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![control panel power options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)

 Launch F1 2021 and check if you get a better PFS. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Optimize in-game graphics settings

 Optimizing the graphics settings is another fix that may boost the in-game FPS, especially if your PC barely meets the minimum system requirements of F1 2021\. If you have a powerful PC, just skip this fix.

 Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower some in-game graphics settings. Here’s how to do it:

1. Launch F1 2021 and go to**GAME OPTIONS** \>**Settings** \>**Graphics Options** \>**Video Mode** . Modify the settings and make it as below:  

 Display Mode: Fullscreen  
 Vsync: Off (Note: If you’re experiencing screen tearing or similar issues, you need to enable Vsync by setting it to_ON_ .)  
 Frame Rate Limit: Off  
 Anti-aliasing: Off  
 HDR: Off
2. Confirm and save the changes. Then go to**GAME OPTIONS** \>**Settings** \>**Graphics Options** \>**Advanced Setup** . Change the settings below:  

 Lighting Quality: Low  
 Post Process: Low  
 Shadows: Low  
 Smoke Shadow: Off  
 Advanced Smoke Shaows: Off  
 Particles: Off  
 Crowd: Low  
 Mirrors: Low  
 Ambient Occlusion: Off  
 Screen Space Reflections: Off  
 Texture Streaming: Ultra Low  
 Vehicle Reflections: Ultra Low  
 Weather Effects: Low  
 Ground Cover: Low  
 Skidmarks: Off  
 Skidmarks Blending: Off  
 SSRT Shadows: Off
3. Save the changes and relaunch the game to see if F1 2021 FPS drops.

If the FPS in F1 2021 still drops, try the next fix, below.

## Modify graphics card settings

 Some players fix this issue after modifying their graphics card settings. If you haven’t tried this fix, just tweak your graphics card settings in Nvidia or AMD control panel to see if the in-game FPS boosts.

**For Nvidia users** , follow the steps below:

1. **Right-click** on your desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** from the context menu.
2. Click **Manage 3D Settings** on the left, then navigate to the **Program Settings** tab. In the **Select a program to customize:**  part, add **F1 2021** from the program list.
3. In the **Specify the settings for this program** section, modify the following settings:  

 Image Sharpening: Off  
 Threaded Optimization: On  
 Power Management: Prefer Maximum Performance  
 Low Latency Mode: Off  
 Vertical sync: Off  
 Texture filtering – Quality: **Performance**
4. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

**For AMD users** , follow the steps below:

1. Open **AMD Radeon Settings** .
2. Go to **Gaming** **\>** **Global Settings** . Then modify the settings the same way you see on the screenshot below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![AMD Radeon Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/AMD-Radeon-Settings.jpg)

 Run F1 2021 to check if the in-game FPS increases. If not, move on to the next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 Overlays are handy, but sometimes they may interfere with F1 2021 and even introduces performance issues and compatibility issues.

 Some PC gamers have reported that disabling the in-game overlay would improve the FPS in F1 2021\. If you’re using the in-game overlay, just disable it to see if the in-game FPS improves.

 There’re many apps that support overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right-click on F1 2021 game title and click **Properties…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. In the **GENERAL** section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable the Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-It-Takes-Two.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features, such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch F1 2021 again after you disabled all the in-game overlays. See if F1 2021 fps drops. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar

 The background recording and Xbox Game Bar feature in Windows 10 are convenient for those who love sharing game highlight videos. However, once enabled, they’ll constantly run in the background, hogging a ton of resources.

 If you’ve turned on background recording and Xbox Game Bar, try disabling them to see if the in-game FPS will improve. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I** key at the same time to open **Windows Settings** . Click **Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Windows 10 settings gaming](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-10-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under **Xbox Game Bar** if it is turned on.  
![Turn off Xbox Game Bar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Xbox-Game-Bar.jpg)
3. Click **Captures** on the left, then **turn off** the toggle under **Background recording** if it is turned on.  
![Turn off background recording](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-background-recording.jpg)

Run F1 2021 to see if you can play it smoothly.
