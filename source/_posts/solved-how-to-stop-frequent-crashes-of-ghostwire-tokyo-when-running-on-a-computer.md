2. Open the file**Engine.ini** in Notepad.
3. To disble Moive / Film Grain, add the following and save the file:  

` **[SystemSettings]**

 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0** `
4. Add the following to the Engine.ini file and save it to disable Depth of Field:  

**`[SystemSettings]**  
 **r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0`**

**`[SystemSettings]**

 **r.Tonemapper.Quality=3**  
 **r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0**
