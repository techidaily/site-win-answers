## Fix 1: Check your network

 The Origin download requires a stable network. If you’re seeing slow speeds, it’s most likely an issue with your network. In this case, you can:

 1)**Restart your router** .

 Unplug your router and after one minute, plug it back in and make it reconnect.

 2)**Temporarily disconnect other devices** .

 With so many devices connected to your network, Origin download can be quite slow. So if possible, disconnect them while downloading.

---

## Fix 2: Update your network adapter driver

 Your Origin’s slow download speed may indicate an issue related to your network connection. And**your outdated network adapter driver** can be the culprit. To fix it, you need to update your network adapter driver, especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated it.

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will**automatically** recognize your system and find the correct driver for it.
