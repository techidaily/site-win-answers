Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® II is out, dropping players into an unprecedented global conflict. Without a doubt, you being one of them would expect to deploy alongside your friends in a truly immersive experience. However, different kinds of issues that ruin your gaming experience occur, one of them being the game not launching. Actually, this is plaguing lots of players. So, don’t fret! In this guide, we’ll outline several methods for you to fix it.

## Try these fixes

 Not all methods are necessary; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Allow your game through Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Run your game launcher as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Close conflicting or non-essential programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. [**Repair corrupted game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Run a full system scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-II-not-launching-1200x675.jpg)

## 1\. Allow your game through Windows Firewall

 When a program fails to load properly, chances are your firewall is blocking it, even though the program you’re starting is legitimate and doesn’t do harm to your system. To ensure your game has access to your connection, take the steps as follows.

1. In the Search box, type **windows firewall** . Then click **Windows Defender Firewall**  from the list of results.  

![Windows Defender Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows-firewall-1.jpg)
2. From the left panel, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  

![allow an app through windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-an-app-through-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)
3. Under the **Allowed apps and features**  section, scroll down and find Modern Warfare II. If it’s not on the list, click **Change settings > Allow another app…** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/allow-modern-warfare-through-windows-firewall.jpg)

 Now navigate to your game’s installation folder and add it to the list. Then check the boxes under**Domain** ,**Private** , and**Public** . Once done, click**OK** to apply the changes.

If this doesn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Run your game launcher as administrator

 In some circumstances, programs would not start properly when they lack administrative rights. To check if that’s what’s happening to you, try running Steam or Battle.net as an administrator by right-clicking on the desktop app. Then see how it goes.

 If the game not launching issue is still bothering you, don’t get frustrated. Below are some troubleshooting steps you can take.

1. Go to your game’s installation folder and locate the .exe file.
2. Right-click it and select Properties.
3. When the Properties window opens, select the Compatibility tab. Then check the box next to Run this program as an administrator. Then click Apply > OK to save the changes.

 After this, try to launch Warfare II and see how it works. If your problem persists, move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Close conflicting or non-essential programs

 Not often, but possible, certain programs on your computer are in conflict with your game title. In addition, having too many programs, especially those memory-hogging programs running in the background can eat up the system resources, causing unexpected issues.

 To stop conflicting or non-essential programs from running, follow the steps below.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit Enter.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the **Processes**  tab, select the program and click **End task** until you close all the unneeded applications.

 (Some gamers did find that the Razer Synapse is more likely to be in conflict with a number of big releases. Therefore, if you have it installed in your computer, stop it from running in the background. )

 Steam will verify the game files. This process may take a few minutes. If there are file validation failures, you can safely ignore the message that pops up.

 Once the verification process is complete, close the window and check if it solves your problem. If your game still fails to launch properly, proceed to the next fix.

## 5\. Update your graphics driver

 To resolve any compatibility issues, one of the first things you should do is to update your drivers. Updates are released routinely. If you’re running a computer with out-of-date drivers, several issues can occur.

### How to update your graphics driver

* [Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update a graphics driver, you’ll first need to know your graphics card’s name and manufacturer.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and hit**Enter** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dxdiag.jpg)
3. When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool loads, select the**Display** tab. Then you’ll find your graphics card’s name and manufacturer listed in the Device section.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Once you find out the brand of your graphics card, visit the manufacturer’s website to get the most up-to-date driver. All you have to do is follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the driver for your system.

* [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
* [AMD](http://www.amd.com/drivers)
* [Intel](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically

 If looking for the correct driver compatible with your operating system seems like a tedious task for you, you can try using an automatic driver updater. A driver updater like **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  helps you scan and detect any missing or outdated drivers, then download and install the latest drivers for your system, direct from the device provider. With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your hunting for driver updates.

2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with outdated drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Run a full system scan

 If none of the methods outlined above work, it’s time to make some tweaks on the system level. It’s that you need to check if you have any corrupted system files, which may be the culprit of your certain programs not functioning properly. To verify if that’s your case, you can use the**System File Checker** tool by running the sfc /scannow command. However, most of the time, it only scans major files and may miss minor issues that could also make your PC error-prone.

 Here[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  comes into play. It’s a legitimate Windows repair tool that scans your computer for invalid registry issues, fragmented files, and Windows tweaks.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click**Start Repair** to let it start the repairing process.
