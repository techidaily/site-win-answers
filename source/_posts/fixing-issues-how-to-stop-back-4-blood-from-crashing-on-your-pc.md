### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus program

 Running WWE 2K20 consumes lots of memory and CPU usage, so it’s possible that your antivirus program may detect it as some sort of threat and prevent it from running smoothly. So you might need to disable your antivirus temporarily and check if the crashing issue persists.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

WWE 2K20 still crashes? Don’t worry, you have one more fix to try.
