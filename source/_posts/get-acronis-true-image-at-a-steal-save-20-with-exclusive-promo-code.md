 Full PC backups or disk cloning and recoveries started it all for Acronis back in 2003, and it's still just as easy to use as ever. The software is compatible with Windows and macOS operating systems, and the bundled cybersecurity can protect up to five computers under a single subscription, not to mention mobile phones and tablets.

 Features, storage, and options will vary based on your subscription. For example, Acronis True Image Advanced offers local and cloud backups, security, and 50GB of cloud storage for an entire year. The premium tier gets you 1TB of cloud storage for free, with paid options up to 5TB. And yes, you can upgrade later as necessary.
