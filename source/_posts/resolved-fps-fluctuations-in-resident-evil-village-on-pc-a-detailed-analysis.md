## Fixes to try

 You don’t need to try them all. Just work your way down until you find the one that solves your problem.

1. **[Rename the exe file](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Run the game as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Use dedicated graphics card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Rename the exe file

 This sounds a bit weird but renaming the game’s exe file works like a charm for many players that can’t start the game normally. Here’s how:

1. Go to game’s installation folder.
2. Rename the**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe** file to**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe.old** .
3. Rename the**ImmortalsFenyxRising\_plus.exe** file to**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe** .

 Relaunch Immortals Fenyx Rising and it should be working properly. If this method doesn’t help, there are more fixes to try.

### Fix 2 – Run the game as an administrator

 To grant Immortals Fenyx Rising necessary permissions to work as intended, you should run it in the administrator mode.

1. Go to the game’s installation folder.
2. Right-click the**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-14.jpg)
3. Click the**Compatibility** tab. Then, check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/im-2.jpg)

 Run the game again to check if your problem gets fixed. If not, continue to the third method.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Gaming issues like Immortals Fenyx Rising not launching may indicate you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix it and improve the game performance, you need to install the latest graphics driver.

There are mainly two ways you can do this:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent correct driver from the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then install it manually. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your monitor driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![amd 6800xt driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). You can also click the**Update** button do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

 You should expect a smooth gameplay after all the device drivers are updated. But if the game still won’t launch, check out the fixes below.

### Fix 4 – Verify the integrity of game files

 If Immortals Fenyx Rising wasn’t installed properly with certain game files missing or damaged, it won’t launch correctly. To see if that’s the case, follow the steps below.

1. Launch your UBISOFT CONNECT Client.
2. Navigate to the**Games** tab, and click the**downward triangle icon** at the lower right corner of the Immortals Fenyx Rising tile.

3. Click**Verify files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-2.jpg)

 Wait until the scan and repair process completes, and restart your game to test. If the not launching problem persists, keep reading the last fix.

### Fix 5 – Use dedicated graphics card

 Modern video games are usually graphics-intensive and require decent machines to run with. Make sure your PC specs satisfies the **[minimum requirements for Immortals Fenyx Rising](https://store.ubi.com/us/game/?lang=en%5FUS&pid=5cec210a39798c0870c07684&dwvar%5F5cec210a39798c0870c07684%5FPlatform=pcdl&edition=Standard%20Edition&source=detail)**  , or else it won’t start in the right way. If you have a powerful setup and have more than one GPU, you should run the game on the dedicated graphics card.
