### Fix 1 â€“ Rename the exe file

 This sounds a bit weird but renaming the gameâ€™s exe file works like a charm for many players that canâ€™t start the game normally. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Go to gameâ€™s installation folder.
2. Rename the**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe** file to**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe.old** .
3. Rename the**ImmortalsFenyxRising\_plus.exe** file to**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe** .

 Relaunch Immortals Fenyx Rising and it should be working properly. If this method doesnâ€™t help, there are more fixes to try.

### Fix 2 â€“ Run the game as an administrator

 To grant Immortals Fenyx Rising necessary permissions to work as intended, you should run it in the administrator mode.

1. Go to the gameâ€™s installation folder.
2. Right-click the**ImmortalsFenyxRising.exe file** and select**Properties** .

3. Click the**Compatibility** tab. Then, check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/im-2.jpg)

 Run the game again to check if your problem gets fixed. If not, continue to the third method.

### Fix 3 â€“ Update your graphics driver

 Gaming issues like Immortals Fenyx Rising not launching may indicate youâ€™re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix it and improve the game performance, you need to install the latest graphics driver.

There are mainly two ways you can do this:

**Option 1 â€“ Manually** â€“ You can search for the most recent correct driver from the manufacturerâ€™s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then install it manually. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Option 2 â€“ Automatically (recommended)** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your monitor driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 4 â€“ Verify the integrity of game files

 If Immortals Fenyx Rising wasnâ€™t installed properly with certain game files missing or damaged, it wonâ€™t launch correctly. To see if thatâ€™s the case, follow the steps below.

1. Launch your UBISOFT CONNECT Client.
2. Navigate to the**Games** tab, and click the**downward triangle icon** at the lower right corner of the Immortals Fenyx Rising tile.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-2.jpg)

 Wait until the scan and repair process completes, and restart your game to test. If the not launching problem persists, keep reading the last fix.

### Fix 5 â€“ Use dedicated graphics card

 Modern video games are usually graphics-intensive and require decent machines to run with. Make sure your PC specs satisfies the **[minimum requirements for Immortals Fenyx Rising](https://store.ubi.com/us/game/?lang=en%5FUS&pid=5cec210a39798c0870c07684&dwvar%5F5cec210a39798c0870c07684%5FPlatform=pcdl&edition=Standard%20Edition&source=detail)**  , or else it wonâ€™t start in the right way. If you have a powerful setup and have more than one GPU, you should run the game on the dedicated graphics card.
