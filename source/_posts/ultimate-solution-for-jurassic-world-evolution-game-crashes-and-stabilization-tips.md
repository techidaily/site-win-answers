### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is vital to the game performance. So, to prevent Jurassic World Evolution from crashing and avoid other potential issues, you should keep your graphics driver up to date.

There are two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Manually** – You can download the most recent correct graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website, such as[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[**Intel**](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) . Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

### Fix 2 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files can cause Jurassic World Evolution to crash, so it’s necessary to validate the game files for troubleshooting.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
4. Wait until the process finishes and re-open the game to test.

 Does Jurassic World Evolution return to normal now? If the crashing issue persists, check out[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

#### On Epic Games Launcher

1. Run the Epic Games Launcher and select the**Library** tab from the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-1-1.jpg)
2. Mouse over the Jurassic World Evolution tile and click the**icons with three dots** . Then click**Verify** on the pop-up menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3 – Remove conflicting applications

 According to other players, some audio applications like**Nahimic Sonic Studio** or**Sonic Radar** will interfere with Jurassic World Evolution and result in the crashing problem. If you have also installed these two programs on your computer, try uninstalling them and see if that helps.

 If you’re still unable to play the game, continue to the next fix then.

### Fix 4 – Disable overlays

 The overlay feature supported by third-party software is also a known culprit for the crashing of many games. Follow the instruction below and make sure overlay is disabled on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Disable Steam overlay

1. Run the Steam client.
2. Click**Steam** at the top left corner and click**Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-1-1.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**In-Game** tab. Then, untick**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-1.jpg)
2. Select**Overlay** and**toggle off Enable in-game overlay** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0-00.jpg)

 Check whether Jurassic World Evolution stops crashing or not. If this method doesn’t give any luck, proceed to the last one.

### Fix 5 – Adjust the graphics settings

 If you’re running Jurassic World Evolution on a low-end PC, it’s suggested you lower the graphics settings for a smoother performance. Here is how:

1. Launch the game and select**Settings** on the main screen.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/graphics-settings-0.jpg)
2. Go to the**Display** section.
3. Change the Screen Mode to**Windowed** and make sure to**turn off VSync** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/graphics-settings-2.jpg)
4. Go Back to the Settings Menu and navigate to the**Graphics** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
5. **Turn down the options** one by one.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/graphics-settings-3.jpg)
