Here is how to reset Winsock data:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and type **cmd** . Then right-click Command Prompt when it comes up as a result and select **Run as administrator** .

 2) When prompted for permission, click**Yes** to run Command Prompt.

 3) In the Command Prompt, type **netsh winsock reset**  and hit **Enter** .
