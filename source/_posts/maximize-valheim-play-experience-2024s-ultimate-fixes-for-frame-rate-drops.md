### Fix 1: Install all Windows updates

 While the ubiquitous Windows update prompts might be annoying to some, keeping the system up to date is actually saving your time by avoiding tons of compatibility issues. So when you’re troubleshooting game issues, it’s always recommended to**check for system updates** first.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .

3. Click**Windows Update** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, do a reboot and check if the stuttering issue persists.

If this fix doesn’t help you, take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 2: Change your power plan

 In the recent build of Windows, users are able to unlock a new power plan called**Ultimate Performance** , which might to some extent improve gaming experience. If you’re willing to try this out, simply do the following:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time. Type or paste **powercfg.cpl**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cmd-run-power-option.jpg)
2. Select **Ultimate Performance** . (If you don’t see this power plan, simply continue to the next step to unhide it.)  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-ultimate-performance.jpg)
3. On your keyboard, press Win (the Windows logo key) and type **cmd** . Select **Run as Administrator** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-cmd-as-administrator.jpg)
4. In the command prompt, type or paste the following command and press **Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61  
 If you see a prompt similar to this, **return to step 2** to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.

Now you test the gameplay in Valorant and check for improvements.

 If this trick doesn’t do the trick for you, simply try the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

**GPU drivers** are essential to your gaming rig and should be kept up to date. The latest graphics driver ensures your graphics card works as intended and helps avoid encountering issues in PC games. So if you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if Valorant stutters again.

If the latest driver doesn’t help you, check out the next method.

### Fix 4: Lower your mouse report rate

 According to some players on reddit, decreasing the mouse report rate, or polling rate, proves effective in alleviating the stuttering in Valorant. So if you’re using a gaming mouse that features a customizable polling rate, try tuning it down to 500 and see how things go.

 If this fix doesn’t give you luck, simply continue to the next one below.

### Fix 5: Turn on VSync

 Some gamers reported that they managed to solve the stuttering by turning Vertical Sync on, so it might be a potential fix you can try. Meanwhile, if VSync doesn’t improve your game, try lowering your in-game graphics and see what happens.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/valorant-low-settings.jpg)

### Fix 6: Empty Standby Memory

This method may require a basic level of computer knowledge.

 Windows sometimes can’t allocate RAM as efficiently as expected. You’ll definitely experience game crashing or stuttering if the system is out of RAM. In some cases, Windows will put**standby memory** (a type of memory usually used as cache) into good use, but you can also free up the standby memory manually.

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** together to open**Task Manager** . Navigate to the**Performance** tab, click**Open Resource Monitor** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/task-manager-resources-monitor-1.jpg)
2. In Resource Monitor, navigate to the**Memory** tab. In the**Physical Memory** section, you’ll see the current memory usage. Check if**Standby Memory** is taking up too much of your total RAM.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/task-manager-resources-monitor-2.jpg)

3. You can empty the standby memory manually.  

 First, download[**EmptyStandbyList**](https://wj32.org/wp/software/empty-standby-list) . This is a command line tool that can help you empty standby memory.
4. Once downloaded, right click the**EmptyStandbyList** program and select**Run as an Administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/emptystandbylist.jpg)
5. Go back to**Resource Monitor** and check if the standby memory has been cleared. Then you can check if the issue persists.

**(Optional)** You can also use**Task Scheduler** to clear the standby memory automatically. Theoretically, you can achieve the same result with a reboot, but it’ll be a different story while you’re in the middle of the game.

1. Right click**EmptySandbyList.exe** and select**Property** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/emptystandbylist-2.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab, check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** . Click**OK** .
