* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

### Fix 3: Disable overclocking or turbo boosting

 If you’re using third-party software to overcook the CPU or GPU to gain better performance, you’d better disable it when running the game. It may be the culprit of the not launching issue.

 So disable the software and reset the CPU or the GPU to the manufacture specification that meets the minimum requirement.

 Some certain overclocking or turbo boosting features need to be disabled from the BIOS. You need to disable the Intel Turbo Booster in BIOS settings if needed.

If this fix doesn’t work, please move to the next one.
