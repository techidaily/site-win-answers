## Fix 1: Close background programs

 Naraka: Bladepoint is likely to crash when too many programs are running in the background and taking up all the resources. You can shut down the background programs via Task Manager:

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab, look for the processes that are CPU, memory, and network-hogging. Take Chrome here, for example, right-click it then click**End task** .

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphic driver is one of the most common reasons for Naraka: Bladepoint keeps crashing on PC. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Device Manager fails to detect an available update, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 4: Repair system files

 In addition to game files, corrupted system files could also cause Naraka: Bladepoint to crash. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system issues. This tool can be handy, but most of the time manual repair is required.

## Fix 5: Increase the virtual memory on your PC

 The developer suggests that insufficient virtual memory could interfere with the game’s performance, and lead to the crashing issue. You can check your virtual memory (paging file size) first, then configure the settings if needed.

**To check your virtual memory** :

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Paste**sysdm.cpl** in the box, then click OK.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-sysdm.cpl-.jpg)
3. Go to the**Advanced** tab, under the Performance section, click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/advanced-performance-settings.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Again switch to the**Advanced** tab, under the Virtual memory section, click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/virtual-memory-change.jpg)
5. Now you’ll see the paging file size on your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-07.jpg)

**To manually allocate paging file size** :

 If you want to increase your virtual memory to fix the crashing issue, or for a better gaming experience, follow the steps below:

1. UNCHECK the box of**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** , then select**Custom size** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-55.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Use the below formulas to calculate the values you should set:  

_**1GB = 1024 MB**_  
 _**Initial size (MB) = 1.5 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_  
_**Maximum size (MB) = 3 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_
3. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, press the**Windows key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Then type in**msinfo32** and click**OK** . You’ll find the information in the pop-up window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-msinfo32.jpg)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Calculate and fill in the**Initial size and Maximum size** , click**Set** then click**OK** . For example, I have 8 GB RAM, so my initial size would be 8\*1024\*1.5=12,288 MB, and my maximum size would be 8\*1024\*3=24576 MB

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)

3. Reboot your computer and launch the game. If it once again won’t crash, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ crash, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Naraka: Bladepoint.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

2. Switch to the**Startup** tab, and**enable the first five startup items** .
