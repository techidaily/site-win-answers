### Fix 1 – Use dedicated GPU

 If you get a high-end graphics card for your PC but still sees the significant FPS drops in War Thunder, chances are that the dedicated GPU is not used, and you should manually select it to tackle the computer’s graphical needs. Here’s how:

 If you don’t have a dedicated GPU at all, you can directly jump to **[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**1)** Right-click any empty space on the desktop and click**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-3-1.jpg)

**2)** Click**3D settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** in the left pane.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-4.jpg)

**3)** Select the**Program Settings** tab and select**War Thunder** from the drop-down list. Then, select**High performance NVIDIA processor** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-5-1-1200x873.jpg)

 If you have an AMD dedicated graphics card and hope War Thunder to run with it, please refer to the official guide here: **[How to Configure Switchable Graphics using Radeon Settings](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/dh-017)**  .

 Test how War Thunder works with the dedicated GPU. If the low FPS remains, you can move on to the next fix.

---

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 The War Thunder low FPS issue is possibly caused by an outdated or a faulty graphics driver. To gain a smooth and optimal gaming experience, you should update your graphics driver on a regular basis.

 There are two ways you can do this: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to their websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  and **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , then find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-1-1.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-2-1.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Start gaming in War Thunder to test the updated graphics driver. If it couldn’t mitigate the FPS drops, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3 – Shut down unnecessary applications

 While you may not be aware, applications running in the background will consume much of your system resource and render War Thunder in low FPS. So, to let your game work without interruption, you can close all unneeded applications before you start a game.

**1)** Right-click the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-3.jpg)

**2)** Right-click the application you want to close and click**End task** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2-2.jpg)

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Now that you’ve left only War Thunder open, it should work as smoothly as possible. If this fix doesn’t help either, please proceed to the next method.

---

### Fix 4 – Change your computer’s power plan

 Windows set your computer to the Balanced power plan by default. There’s no problem with this option, but if you constantly run into the decreased gaming performance like FPS drops, you should adjust the power settings.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then, type**control** in the field and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/w4-1.jpg)

**2)** Select**Small icons** from the drop-down menu next to**View by** and click**Power Options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-2-1.jpg)

**3)** Click**High performance** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364" border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-3.jpg)

 Restart your computer so that the changes will take effect. Then, launch War Thunder to check if the FPS drops are still there. If yes, there are two more fixes below.

---

### Fix 5 – Adjust the in-game graphics settings

 High or ultra graphics settings sometimes won’t give you the visual effect as you want, but make the game perform worse, especially if your rig is barely above the minimum requirements. If so, the very solution is to lower the settings.

**1)** Open War Thunder. Then, click the**gear icon** to enter the Settings menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-3.jpg)

**2)** Turn off**VSync** . Then, set each option under**Advanced Settings** to the lowest, as shown in the picture below.

 After those tweaks, play War Thunder again and see if the FPS improves. If yes, you could lift the settings a bit until you find the best combination that works. If not, turn to the last fix.
