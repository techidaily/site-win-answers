If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. This may help fix the error.

To verify the integrity of game files:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to**LIBRARY** , then right click on the game where the fatal error occurs and click**Properties…** .

6. Once finished, launch the game to see if it can be played properly. If yes, congrats! If it’s still no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** . below.
