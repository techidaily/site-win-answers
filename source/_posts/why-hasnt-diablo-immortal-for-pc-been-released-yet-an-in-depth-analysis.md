### Fix 2 – Launch the game in windowed mode

 There are increasing reports about Diablo Immortal crashing in fullscreen. To avoid it crashing on startup, you can force the game to launch in windowed mode. Here’s how:

1. Launch the**Battle.net** launcher and select**Diablo Immortal** from the top pane.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/force-windowed-mode-1.jpg)
2. Click the**gear icon** next to the Play button and click**Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/force-windowed-mode-2.jpg)
3. Tick**Additional command line arguments** . Then type**\-w** in the field and click**Done** at the bottom right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/force-windowed-mode-3.jpg)

 Now that you’ve applied the changes, relaunch the game to test the issue. If the crashes persist, move on to the third fix below.

### Fix 3 – Rename the game folder

 It’s hard to explain why but renaming the Diablo Immortal folder is a simple trick that helped many users to run the game properly. To do this, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the**game’s installation folder** . Generally you can find it at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Battlenet.
2. Rename the**Diablo Immortal folder** to Diablo Immortal1 or whatever you like.
3. Open the**Diablo Immortal Launcher** directly from the folder.

 Check if the game works normally now. If not, revert the folder’s name and try the next method.

### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card driver is very essential for gaming performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you may suffer from various performance issues of Diablo Immortal including game crashes, low FPS and stuttering. And you should update the graphics driver for maximum gameplay.

 Major GPU manufacturers frequently release new graphics drivers which will give performance improvements, particularly for newer games. Simply go to their official websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system and download it manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct GPU drivers for your Windows version. And it only takes two steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

### Fix 5 – Scan and repair game files

 Verifying the game files is a common workaround for you to resolve random crashes or failed installations. If there’s something wrong with the game files, you can have them repaired following the instruction below.

1. Open the**Battle.net launcher** .
2. Select**Diablo Immortal** from the game list. Then click the**gear icon** beside the Play button and click**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/scan-game-files.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/scan-game-files-2-1.jpg)

 The scanning will start immediately, followed by a repair update if missing or corrupt files are found. Once done, restart the game and see how it works. Still no luck? There is one more fix to try.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-2-1-1.jpg)
