## Fix 1: Uncheck bonus content under DLC

 If your Cyberpunk download is stuck on 57.4 GB, it probably is extracting the game files. This happens with preloaded games on Steam. So you just need a little more patience and you’ll be in. However, if you can’t wait for any longer, disabling the DLC content download may help you.

 1) Under the**LIBRARY** tab, navigate to your game**Cyberpunk 2077** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-on-Properties-on-Steam.jpg)

 2) Select the tab**DLC** . Then uncheck the box**Cyberpunk 2077 Bonus Content** . (If the DLC portion isn’t popping up for you, try restarting your computer and after that, try to log in to your Steam account.)  
  
![uncheck bonus content under DLC to fix Cyberpunk 2077 download stuck ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DLC-uncheck-install.jpg)

 Once done, you should be able to fix the game stuck at 57.4/64 GB issue. If this didn’t work for you, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Change Steam download server

 When there are so many players downloading the game, servers might be overloaded. Changing Steam download server can help you fix it. Here are the steps you can take:

 1) From your Steam Client, open the Settings panel by selecting**Steam** \>**Settings** from the top left client menu.  
  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![change the Steam download server location](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location.jpg)

 2) In the Settings panel, select the**Downloads** tab. Then in the**Download Region** section, choose another download region in the drop-down menu. According to the tests, Asian servers can substantially increase your download speed. It’s probably because there’s less traffic congestion.  
  
![change Steam download server](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location-donwnload-region.jpg)
  
 After applying the changes, resume your download to check if this boosts your download speed.

 You can also check[Steam Download Stats](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/) to avoid the high traffic.

## Fix 3: Set Steam’s priority to High

 Waiting for Steam games to update or download can be vexing. And you would be quite frustrated with the slow unpacking speed. But the good news is, setting Steam’s priority to High in the Task Manager can help you. Follow the steps below to do that:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open Task Manager.

## Fix 4: Update network adapter driver

 Whether you have a slow download speed or you’re stuck at downloading, it could be an issue related to your network connection. And your outdated network adapter driver can be the culprit. To fix it, you’re supposed to update your network adapter driver, especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated it.

 You can manually update your network adapter driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct network driver for your system.

OR

 You can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how it works:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

## Fix 5: Clear download cache

 Clearing your download cache can solve problems with game’s slow download speed or other download issues. This process will not affect your currently installed games, but you’ll need to log into Steam afterwards. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) From your Steam Client, open the Settings panel by selecting**Steam** \>**Settings** from the top left client menu.  
  
![Steam go to settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/change-the-download-server-location.jpg)

 2) In the Settings panel, select the**Downloads** tab and you’ll find the**CLEAR DOWNLOAD CACHE** button at the bottom. Simply click on it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![clear download cache Steam](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/clear-download-cache.jpg)

 3) Select**OK** to confirm and acknowledge that you’ll need to login to Steam again.
