## Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 Halo Infinite stuttering or lagging problem is usually related to the graphic driver. Make sure your GPU is fully up to date, the older GPU drivers can lead to poor performance and micro stutter.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

7) Run the game to check.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Turn off background apps

 1) Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open Task Manager.

 2) In the**Process** tab, click the app and click**End task** .

 3) Turn off all the background apps then run Halo Infinite to check if the issue persists.

## Fix 5: Change NVIDIA resolution

 Open the NVIDIA control panel and change the resolution from 4k to 1440p. Click**Apply > Yes** to save the change.

 Jump back to the game and check the game. If it’s smooth, no stuttering, you can open NVIDIA control panel and change resolution back to 4K. The game should stay well.
