### 1\. Switch to DX11

 Some players reported on Reddit that they managed to stop game crashes by forcing the game to start in DX11 mode instead of DX12\. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

2. Under the GENERAL tab, enter**\-force -dx11** into the dialog box under the LAUNCH OPTIONS.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/force-dx11.png)

 Now relaunch your game. If forcing the game to start in DX11 mode doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

### 2\. Verify integrity of game files

 A variety of issues such as game crashing on PC may be caused by corrupted game files. To troubleshoot your issue, you need to verify your game files on Steam. Below are the steps you can take.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.png)
2. Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Then click on the button**Verify integrity of game files…** .

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

 Steam will now verify all of your game files, and compare them with files hosted on the game servers. If there are any discrepancies Steam will redownload, and repair corrupted files.

 When the process is complete, launch your game. If your problem persists, try the next fix below.

### 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When your game keeps crashing, you would need to consider whether it’s caused by an outdated or misconfigured graphics driver. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting. Additionally, graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to guarantee that you can get the most out of your graphics card.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an**automatic driver updater** such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/scan-now-v5_7_0.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating drivers, restart your PC. Then launch your game and you should be able to enjoy your gameplay without much interruptions.

## If your game still crashes

 However, if your game still crashes a lot even though you had updated your drivers and made sure your PC meets the system requirements, you can try to repair your PC. Program issues can be caused by corrupted system files. While running a scan of a PC can help you diagnose problems and fix them immediately. For that job, we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a professional computer repair software that will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally, it detects programs that crash.

Here’s how you can run a scan of your PC with Reimage:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Start Fortect and it will run a FREE scan of your PC. Once the scan is finished, you’ll see a complete overview of your system and issues.
3. Click**Start Repair** to start the repair process and wait for Fortect to fix the problem.

## How to fix the stuttering issue

 Nothing all methods are necessary; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable V-Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable Steam overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Enable game mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Delete temp files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Disable V-Sync

 Short for vertical sync, V-Sync is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of your game to the refresh rate of your monitor. Unfortunately, sometimes V-Sync reduces the input responsiveness of your system while gaming, which can cause your computer to crash. And performance issues would arise.

 To see if this is what’s causing your Bloodhunt to stutter a lot, you should disable V-Sync by following the instructions below.

1. Launch your game. Then press Esc on your keyboard.
2. Select**SETTINGS** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/press-ESC-and-select-SETTINGS.png)
3. Select**GRAPHICS** . Under**BASIC** , make sure the option ENABLE VSYNC is unchecked.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/uncheck-enable-vsync.png)
4. Then apply the changes.

 If disabling V-Sync doesn’t give you any luck, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Disable Steam overlay

 Commonly used in various programs, overlay technology allows you to surf the web and enjoy other features, but can also cause performance issues with some games. Therefore, you may need to disable the Steam overlay and check if it can reduce Bloodhunt in-game stutters. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.png)
2. In the GENERAL tab, uncheck the box**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png" border="0">Easy and Safe Partition Software & Hard Disk Manager</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disable-overlay.png)

 If the above doesn’t solve your issue, make sure you’re not running the Rivatuner overlay. Players who are running it are more likely to notice in-game stutters.

### 3\. Enable game mode

 After the new release of Windows updates, the game mode feature helps users increase gaming performance by deactivating background activities like app notifications. So you can actually enable this feature to benefit from it. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Click **Gaming** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gaming.png)
3. Select **Game Mode**  from the left panel. Then toggle **On**  Game Mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/turn-on-game-mode.png)

 After applying the changes, test your gameplay. If you still notice severe in-game stutters, try the next fix below.

Follow the instructions to do this.

1. Right-click on the empty space from your desktop and select **Display settings** .
