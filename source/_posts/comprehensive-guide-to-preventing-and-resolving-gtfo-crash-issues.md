## Stop Code Vein From Crashing! Discover Easy Ways to Resolve Freezing Issues

_Code Vein_ randomly freezes your computer? You’re not alone! Many players are reporting it. But the good news is that you can fix it. Here is a list of solutions that have proved useful to many users.

## Why does _Code Vein_ keep freezing?

 Common causes of game freezing are hardware issues, incompatible drivers, corrupted game files, or overheating. Besides, you’re likely to run into the game freezing issue if you’re running multiple programs on your computer at the same time, hogging your resources. If you’re not sure how to deal with this, check the fixes below.

## Check your computer specifications

 Game issues, such as freezing, lagging and crashing, occur when your computer fails to meet the minimum system requirements to run the game. If that’s the problem for you, you’ll need to play the game on another PC.

 So, before you start troubleshooting, make sure your computer meets **_Code Vein_ ‘s minimum system requirements** :

| **OS:**            | Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 10 (64-bit) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i5-2300                   |
| **RAM** :          | 6 GB RAM                             |
| **Graphics Card:** | GeForce GTX 760 or Radeon HD 7850    |
| **DirectX:**       | Version 11                           |
| **RAM** :          | 35 GB available space                |

2. **[Run_Code Vein_ as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify the integrity of your game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[End unnecessary background programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Set your PC power plan to High Performance](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 The_Code Vein_ freezing issue is most likely to occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So, updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your game. There are two ways you can do this:

* **[Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 2: **Run Code Vein as an administrator**

_Code Vein_ may not be able to access certain game files on your computer under user mode, which could cause the freezing issue. To see if that’s the problem for you, try running your game as an administrator to give it high integrity access. Here is how to do it:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

* **[If you’re on Windows 7…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[If you’re on Windows 8 or 10…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Try launching _Code Vein_  to see if it works properly now. If your issue persists, check the next fix.

### Fix 5: Set your PC power plan to High Performance

 The power plan on all computers is set to the Balanced mode by default. Under this mode, your computer might slow down automatically to save energy, which could cause some programs to freeze or crash.

 If that’s the problem for you, you’ll need to change your power plan to **High performance** . Here is how to do it:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-43-26.jpg)

**2)** Under **View by,** click **Large icons** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-43-34.jpg)

**3)** Select **Power Options.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**4)** Select **High Performance** .

**What’re the differences?**
**Balanced:**  Balanced mode automatically adjusts your CPU’s speed according to your computer’s needs.  
**High Performance:** High Performance mode keeps your PC running at high speeds most of the time.  
 **Note that your computer will generate more heat under High Performance mode.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-43-53.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**5)** Restart your computer and your game.

 You should be able to run_Code Vein_ without freezing now. If the issue still exists, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, your programs such as_Code Vein_ are likely to freeze.

 Follow the instructions below to adjust the size of your virtual memory and see if this is causing your problem:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_10-44-24.jpg)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**
