## 1\. Check system requirements

So if your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Cities: Skylines 2 to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

| Minimum   | Recommended                                                   |                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 2\. Make sure your computer is not running hot

 If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Cities: Skylines 2 doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 3\. Update Windows

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Click**Check for updates** , and Windows will scan for any available updates.
