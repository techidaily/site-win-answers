### Fix 4: Update your network driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated network driver, you may encounter many problems when playing online games, like the Error code: Crossbow in Minecraft. To see if that’s the case for you, you should make sure your network driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the motherboard manufacturer’s website and search for your model, then download and install the network driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

### Fix 6: Use a VPN

 VPN is short for Virtual Private Networking. It can protect your privacy and improve your network when you’re surfing the Internet. So during rush hours, you can**try using a VPN to gain a better Internet connection** , which may help you fix the Minecraft login error. If you’re not sure which VPN to choose, we recommend **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[Cyberghost VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . ( _Note: Avoid using free VPNs, since they rarely resolve your issues but could bring many problems._ )

 You can check out the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy Coupon site](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for juicy VPN deals. Basically, they all have a money-back guarantee.

### Fix 7: Reinstall Minecraft

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .
