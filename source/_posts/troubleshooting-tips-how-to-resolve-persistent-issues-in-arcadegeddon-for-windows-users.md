## 2: Reinstall NVIDIA Driver

In some cases, GeForce Experience install programs that are not graphics driver on your PC. So you should reinstall NVIDIA display driver all over again.

If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee): 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59bf9a8fa563d.png)3) Click the**Update**button next to the flagged NVIDIA device to automatically download and install the correct version of its driver (you can do this with the FREE version).
