## Ultimate Tricks to Minimize Latency & Maximize Frame Rates in the Fun-Filled World of Fall Guys

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is finally out, but more and more players start complaining about**low FPS** when they’re bouncing around. If you happened to be one of them, don’t worry. Here’re 7 working fixes that could help you reduce lag and grab a crown in Fall Guys.

## Try these fixes

 You might not have to try them all, simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Make sure your PC meets the requirement](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable full screen optimization](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Change your power plan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Close unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. [**Adjust in-game settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the requirement

 Though Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is not exactly a graphically demanding game, having a decent setup always gives you a leg up. So check if your computer specs meet the minimum requirements below. If not, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

#### Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout system requirements (Minimum)

| **Supported OS** :  | Windows 10 64-bit only               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Processor** :     | Intel Core i5 or AMD equivalent      |
| **RAM:**            | 8 GB                                 |
| **Graphics Card** : | NVIDIA GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7950 |

 If you’re sure your computer is powerful enough for the game, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Disable full screen optimization

 Recent Windows 10 builds include a new feature named**Full Screen Optimization** , which improves performance of games or apps when they’re running in full screen mode. But there’re also reports that this feature might bring about side effects. So it’s possible that you can fix the lag issues by disabling this feature.

To disable Full Screen Optimization, follow these steps:

1. Open the file location where Fall Guys is installed on your computer.
2. Right click**FallGuys\_client.exe** and select **Properties** .
3. Navigate to the **Compatibility** tab, and check the box next to **Disable fullscreen optimizations** . Click**OK** to finish.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fallguys-disable-full-screen.jpg)

Now you can open Fall Guys and check if the problem has gone.

If the issue is still there, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The Fall Guys lag issue can be caused by**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If you’re not sure whether you’re using the latest graphics driver, you should definitely have a check. Driver updates are basically a zero-cost benefit, so it’s always a smart move to keep your drivers up to date.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), downloading the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to do that manually, you can use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update automatically:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-04_17-40-32-2.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rtx-2060-de-install.jpg)
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve completed these steps, open Fall Guys and test your gameplay.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

Here’re the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **I**  at the same time to invoke **Windows Settings app** . Select **Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-setting-app-security-update.jpg)
2. Click **Check for updates** . It’ll try to download and install available updates. It might take a while depending on your network speed.

### Fix 5: Change your power plan

 Power plans are simply a set of predefined settings to manage how your computer consumes or preserves power. By default, your computer is running at the “Balanced” power plan, which makes your computer less power-hungry. But this might affect your gaming experience as it puts a limit on some of the functions.

 Actually, Windows 10 recently introduced a hidden power plan called**Ultimate Performance** , which might give an extra boost to your system. To enable this power plan, follow these steps:

 The Ultimate Performance power plan is only available to Windows 10 version**1803 or above** . You can check your version in**Settings > System > About** .

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the **Run** dialog. Type **control** and click **OK**  to open Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-box-dialog-control.jpg)
2. **View** the Control Panel **by Category** . Select**Hardware and Sound** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-cmd-as-administrator.jpg)
6. In the pop-up window, type (or copy and paste) the following command and hit**Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61  
 If you see a prompt similar to this,**go back to step 3** to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-cmd-unhide-ultimate-performance.jpg)

### Fix 6: Close unnecessary programs

 One possible cause of lag might be the background tasks that are eating your resources secretly. To ensure a smooth and undisturbed gameplay, Fall Guys should be the only large program running on your computer. So before you start the game, make sure you’ve closed Chrome, Skype, Discord and any other programs that might be resource-hungry.

### Fix 7: Adjust in-game settings

 The Fall Guys lag issue might be triggered by improper graphics settings. For example, if you choose a setting that’s too demanding for your rig, you might not get the corresponding experience you desired. To check if the lag issue is related to game settings, lower the in-game graphics settings and see if it reduces the lag.

 Launch Fall Guys and go to**Graphics Settings** . Change your settings according to this list:

* Preset: Custom
* Resolution: 1920×1080 60Hz
* Windowed: Off
* V-Sync: Off
* Texture Detail: Half Res
* Shadows Detail: Low
* Motion Blur: Off
* Bloom: Off
* Depth Of Field: Off
* Ambient Occlusion: None
* Antialiasing: None
* Anisotropic Filtering: Off
* Screen Space Reflections: None
