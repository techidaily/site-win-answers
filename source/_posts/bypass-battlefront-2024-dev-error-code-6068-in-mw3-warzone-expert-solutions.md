### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Battlefront 2 is no exception. To keep your game work like a charm, you’ll need to update the graphics driver.

 You can get the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , who keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

### Fix 3: Reset Battlefront 2

 If you fail to stop your Battlefront 2 from crashing, you can try to reset your Battlefront 2 settings. Sometimes your game crashing can be triggered by certain settings. Here’s how to do it:

1) Quit Battlefront 2 and close Origin/Steam.

2) Go to**%USERNAME%Documents** and delete the entire**Star Wars: Battlefront II** folder.

3) Play Battlefront 2 again to test the issue.

 This fix works for most PC users, but if this doesn’t work for your case, don’t worry. There’re a few more fixes you can try.

### Fix 4: Revert back to DX11

 Many Battlefront 2 players find reverting to DX11 helps reduce random crashes. Here’s how to do it:

 1) Go to**%USERNAME%DocumentsSTAR WARS Battlefront IIsettings** .

 2) Right-click**BootOptions.ini** file (if there is one), and select**Edit with Notepad++** .

 3) Change**GstRender.EnableDx12 1** to**GstRender.EnableDx12 0** and save the file.

 You should now be able to run this game without a hitch. If Battlefront 2 keeps crashing, you can enable DX12 again.

**Note:** If you find reverting to DX11 makes your game laggy, you can edit**BootOptions.ini** again to enable DX12.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Run as administrator

 When the game keeps crashing, you can always run both your game launcher and game.exe file as administrator. To make sure your game runs smoothly, you can run your game as an administrator permanently.

 1) Right-click Origin/Steam and select**Properties** .

 2) Go to the**Compatibility** tab and select**Run this program as administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/compatibility.jpg)

 3) Click**Apply** \>**OK** .

 4) Go to your game installation folder and run your game exe file as administrator too.

 This works for many PC players, but if it doesn’t do the trick for you, don’t be upset.

### Fix 6: Disable antivirus software temporarily

 Since Battlefront 2 consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when it’s running, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and cause Battlefront 2 crashing issues.

 To see if this is the culprit of game crashes, you can disable your antivirus applications temporarily. Alternatively, you can add the entire Battlefront 2 folder to its list of exclusions.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If the game keeps crashing, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the**Run** box.

 2) Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open **System Configuration** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/msconfig.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1005.png)

 7) Restart your PC and launch your Battlefront 2 to see if the game launches normally.

 If your game runs perfectly this time, congratulations! If you need to find the problematic software. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the**System Configuration** .
2. Enable the service **one by one** (restart your PC and test the issue after enabling each service or start-up) until you find the problematic one.

### Fix 8: Disable Discord In-Game Overlay

 If you’re using any programs with overlay features such as Discord, disabling In-Game Overlay may help you reduce your random game crashes on your PC.

#### 1\. To disable it entirely

 1) Open Discord and click**Settings** (the gear icon).

 2) Navigate to **the Overlay** tab on the left pane.

 3) Toggle off **Enable in-game overlay** .

#### 2\. To disable it just for Battlefront 2

 1) Click the **Settings** icon

 2) Click on **Games** in the navigation bar

 3) Toggle**Star Wars: Battlefront 2** to **Off** .

---

 Try playing your game again to see if the crashing still persists. If unfortunately not, you’ll probably need to do a clean reinstallation of Star Wars: Battlefront 2\. Here’s how to do it quickly:

* Press**Win + R** to open the**Run** box.
* Type**appwiz.cpl** and hit**Enter** .
* Right-click**Star Wars: Battlefront 2** and select**Uninstall** .

 After uninstalling, don’t forget to clear the roaming and local files. Press **Windows logo key** \+ **R** to bring out the**Run** box, then enter **%appdata%** . After that, delete the related game files in the **Roaming** folder. Also, go backward to **AppData** and clear the related game files in the **Local**  file folder.

 If reinstalling the game doesn’t help at all, you might need to wait for the latest game patch.
