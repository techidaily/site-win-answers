### Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 The broken or outdated graphics driver often play a key role in not launching or crashing issues. Graphic driver will effect your graphic card and influence your gaming experience. The fix is simple, updating your graphic driver to the latest version which compatible with your operating system.

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 3: Disable overclocking or turbo boosting

 If you’re using third-party software to overcook the CPU or GPU to gain better performance, you’d better disable it when running the game. It may be the culprit of the not launching issue.

 So disable the software and reset the CPU or the GPU to the manufacture specification that meets the minimum requirement.

 Some certain overclocking or turbo boosting features need to be disabled from the BIOS. You need to disable the Intel Turbo Booster in BIOS settings if needed.

If this fix doesn’t work, please move to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your DirectX files

 It Takes Two asks for DirectX 11 to run properly. If the DirectX files is corrupted or missing, the game would not launch or crash on startup. Therefore, updating the DirectX files to the latest version would fix the issue.

1. Go to the[Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtime Web Install page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .
2. Click the**Download** button.
