### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of Genshin Impact not launching is a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. GPU manufacturers will keep releasing driver updates along with new game patches. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a while, definitely do it now to see if that fixes your issue.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

#### **Option 1 – Download the install the driver manually**

 You can visit the official websites of the graphics cards manufacturers ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), find the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and then download it manually. This process will require some computer skills and patience.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

### Fix 3 – Install the latest DirectX and Visual C++ redistributable files

 If Genshin Impact doesn’t launch and you’re receiving specific errors like 0xc000007b or MSVCP140.dll cannot be found, installing the latest DirectX files and Visual C++ files might resolve your issue.

1. Go to the[DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) and click**Download** .

3. Go to the[Visual C++ download page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) and download the latest Visual C++ redistributable package for your Windows.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/visual-c-page.jpg)
4. Once downloaded, run the exe.file and click**Repair** (or**Install** ) to initiate the setup.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/visual-c-file.jpg)

 Now that you’ve installed the latest DirectX and Visual redistributable files, see if Genshin Impact works. If not, proceed to the next method.

### Fix 4 – Perform a clean boot

 The Genshin Impact not launching issue may be triggered by certain conflicting services or applications running in the background. To determine whether that’s the cause and what is exactly preventing the game, you should perform a clean boot via the following steps:

1. In the Windows search box, type**system configuration** and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1-4.jpg)
2. Select the**Services** tab. Then tick**Hide all Microsoft services** and click**Disable all** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-3.jpg)
3. Choose the**Startup tab** and click**Open Task Manager** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-2-1.jpg)
4. Navigate to the**Startup** tab. Right-click each enabled item and click**Disable** . Then close the window.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-4.jpg)
5. Go back to the System Configuration window and click**OK** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-3-1.jpg)
6. Click**Restart** when prompted.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-2-4.jpg)

 After the computer starts up, launch Genshin Impact to check if the issue persists. If it works without trouble,**enable the services one or a few like four or five at a time** . If the game works fine, there is no problem with these services. Then repeat the steps until you’ve checked all the services.

 If the services are not the culprits, **open Task Manager to enable the startup items (4 or 5 in a group)** to rule out the problematic applications. Some players reported that the Faceit app might interfere with Genshin Impact.

 If you find any services or applications that stop the game from launching, simply disable them before you play the game.

**IMPORTANT** : Once you’ve completed the troubleshooting process, you have to reset your computer to start normally. Follow the instruction below.

1. Type**system configuration** in the Windows search box and click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1-4.jpg)
2. Under the General tab, tick**Normal startup** and click**OK** .
