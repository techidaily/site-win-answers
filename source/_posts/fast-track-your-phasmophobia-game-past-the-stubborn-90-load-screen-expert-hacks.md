## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Using outdated drivers can affect performance. So we recommend checking for driver updates on a regular basis. When you encounter the issue of a loading screen stuck, updating your drivers especially your graphics driver could be the best shot you take.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-phasmophobia-stuck-at-90-loading-screen/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1 – Manually update your drivers

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , and[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) keep releasing driver updates. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will**automatically** recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

## Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs like the screen stuck at loading. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Launch Steam client. From the**LIBRARY** section, right-click on**Phasmophobia** and select**Properties** from the menu.

 3) Steam will verify the game’s files and this process may take several minutes. After it’s finished, launch your game to check if it works for you. If not, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Delete the game’s save file

 If your game files are corrupt, they can cause your game to be stuck on the loading screen. Deleting the files can sometimes resolve the problem:

 4) Now relaunch your game to check if the issue is fixed.

 Deleting the saved file has proven to be working for many users. But it probably would delete your progress.

## Fix 5: Run Steam as an administrator

 Granting Steam administrative rights would probably let you play your game smoothly. So here, you can run Steam in Administrator mode.

 1) Right-click on the Steam shortcut from your desktop and select **Open file location** .

## Fix 6: Reset your network

 The game stuck at 90% loading screen is an issue related to network connections. When you are troubleshooting it, one of the recommended tips is to reset the network settings. Network reset is a feature that restores all the network-related features and settings to their original values — factory state. So to fix the issue, you need to do a network reset.

Here’s how you can do this:

 1) In the Search bar, type **network reset** and click **Network reset**  from the results.  
  
![reset network](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/network-reset-type-in-the-search-bar.jpg)

 2) Click **Reset now** .
