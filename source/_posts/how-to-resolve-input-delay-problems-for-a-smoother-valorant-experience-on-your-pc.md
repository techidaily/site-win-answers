### Fix 1: Re-add your friend

 I believe you‚Äôve already tried restarting Minecraft maybe even restart your computer. There is one more thing you can try: re-add your friend.

 If you find you can still connect to a stranger‚Äôs world, you can remove the person as a friend then re-add him/her back. This fix has helped some players.

### Fix 3: Disable Windows Firewall

 If Minecraft is not allowed in the Firewall, the ‚ÄúUnable to connect to world‚Äù issue can happen. You can connect to the internet but can‚Äôt join each other‚Äôs world. So check the Firewall settings and ensure the Minecraft executable file ‚Äújavaw.exe‚Äù is allowed in the Firewall.

1. Click the Windows start button, type**control panel** and press the**Enter** key on your keyboard to open Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c.jpg)
2. Set Control Panel view by**Large icons** then click**Windows Defender Firewall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c2.jpg)
3. Click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3.jpg)
4. Make sure the ‚Äújavaw.exe‚Äù is checked. If not, click the Change settings button then check the ‚Äújavaw.exe‚Äù. If you see more than one ‚Äújavaw.exe‚Äù entries, check all of them. Ensure the Private box and the Publick box are checked too.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_5c260821a6772.png)

 If the Minecraft.exe is checked, this fix doesn‚Äôt work for you. Move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update the network drivers

 Outdated network drivers may cause the ‚ÄúUnable to connect to world‚Äù issue. So you can try to update the network driver to fix the problem.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don‚Äôt need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don‚Äôt need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

### Fix 5: Change the settings

 Check your and your friends‚Äô settings on Xbox.com. The changed settings may be the reason why you‚Äôre unable to connect to the world.

1. Go to the[Xbox official website](https://account.xbox.com/Settings) .
2. Click the**Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Privacy** tab.
3. Find**Join multiplayer games** and make sure it‚Äôs set to**Allow** .
4. Click**Submit** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/x.jpg)

### Fix 6: Disable antivirus software

 Some antivirus software may block some features in Minecraft so that you can encounter the ‚Äúunable to connect to world‚Äù issue. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

---

### Fix 7: Use a VPN

 The ‚ÄúUnable to connect to world‚Äù issue may be caused by internet problems. It is possible these situations may interpret your connection to your friends‚Äô world: servers are full, your area has certain restrictions that may affect the connection, etc. Then you can use a VPN service to solve the problem. VPN can bypass geo-restrictions and let you connect with the server in any place in the world directly.

 You can use the VPN you already have, if you don‚Äôt have one, it‚Äôs recommended to use [NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a famous brand. Its server location covers 60 countries and the safety of this VPN is absolutely stunning. Also, it has a fast speed that can meet your needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN in your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nord.jpg)

**Coupon TIP** : Get a **[NordVPN coupon code](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  before you buy it!

 If it doesn‚Äôt work, you can contact your ISP for more information. Some players reported the ISP would block their ability to use all Minecraft servers. You need to persist and they‚Äôll make a change.

## Bonus tips

#### For iPad users

 If you‚Äôre an iPad user who has the ‚ÄúUnable to Connect to World‚Äù issue, you can go to iPad Settings, Minecraft (not in the Minecraft app), and be allowed access to ‚ÄúLocal Network‚Äù. When you back into Minecraft again, it should work.

#### For Xbox users

 Make sure your Xbox One NAT is open. Switching to a different Microsoft account sometimes helps.
