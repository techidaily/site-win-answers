| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i3-4170 or higher    |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 650Ti or AMD R7 250X |
| **Storage** :      | 70GB available space            |

 Here are the**recommended** system requirements to run_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit              |

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the_Forza Horizon 4_ not launching problem is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. You should update your graphics driver to see if that’s the case for you.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-07_14-49-12.jpg)
