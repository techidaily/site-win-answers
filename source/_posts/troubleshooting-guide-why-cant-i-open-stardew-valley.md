## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The HLL developers release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Hell Let Loose again to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Disable Steam Overlay

 Although Overlays are handy, sometimes they may interfere with the game. According to some PC players, it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with HLL. Try disabling Steam Overlay for HLL and see if the game crashes again. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** .**right-click** on _Hell Let Loose_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck**Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  

![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch HLL and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you may need to reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 See if HLL crashes after you stopped overclocking. If this fix failed to resolve this issue, try the next fix, below.

 Another possible cause of the HLL crashing issue is program conflicts. If there is a certain program conflicting with HLL, it will lead to the crashing issues. In this case, you need to perform a clean boot to find out the problematic program that crashes the game. Here's how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.
