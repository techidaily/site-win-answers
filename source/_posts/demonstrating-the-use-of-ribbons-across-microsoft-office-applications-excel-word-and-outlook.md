### Key Takeaways

 To bring your Office ribbon back, either double-click a ribbon tab or right-click a ribbon tab and disable "Collapse the Ribbon." If you don't see any ribbon tabs, in your screen's top-right corner, click the up-arrow icon and choose "Show Tabs and Commands," and then click "Auto-Hide Ribbon."

 Has [your Excel, Word, or Outlook app's ribbon](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-honor-play-40c-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/) suddenly disappeared? It's easy to hide it accidentally, and sometimes the tabs disappear too. In either case, you can bring it back in your Office app on your Windows or Mac machine in a few clicks. Here's how.

 The following guide uses Excel for demonstration. You'll use the same steps in both Word and Outlook.

##  Show Your Office Ribbon When You Can See the Tabs

 If [you can see the ribbon tabs](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-measure-the-performance-of-igtv-videos-for-2024/) but not their commands at the top of your Excel, Word, or Outlook app, follow the instructions here to make the commands visible.

 One way to unhide your tab's commands is by double-clicking a tab name. This method works for Office's current and upcoming Visual Refresh interface.

 Another way to unhide your tab commands is by right-clicking a tab and choosing "Collapse the Ribbon." (Doing so disables the option, allowing your tab commands to be visible.)

![Select the up-arrow icon at the top-right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2-excel-ribbon-menu.png) 

 In the open menu, select "Show Tabs and Commands."

 If [your ribbon](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/solved-apex-legends-no-sound/) has disappeared completely, meaning you don't even see the ribbon tabs in your Excel, Word, or Outlook app, use the following instructions to unhide your ribbon temporarily or permanently.
