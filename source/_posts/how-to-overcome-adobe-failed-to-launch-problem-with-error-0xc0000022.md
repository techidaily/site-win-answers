### Fix 3: **Run Epic Games Launcher and Fortnite as administrator**

 In some cases, Fortnite won’t launch properly because it is not granted the necessary access to running the game. To make sure the LS-0013 error is not thrown up because of insufficient rights, you should run **Epic Games Launcher** and **Fortnite** as administrator.

Here is how to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator:

 1) On your desktop, right-click on the **Epic Games Launcher icon** and select **Properties** .

 2) Click the **Compatibility**  tab, tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator**  and click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-805.png)

 3) Run Fortnite to see if it works without fail. If yes, then you have solved the issue! If the error still happens, you can then run Fortnite**as administrator** , the steps are similar as those for Epic Games Launcher.

 Once finished, don’t forget to check if the Fortnite**LS-0013** error is resolved.
