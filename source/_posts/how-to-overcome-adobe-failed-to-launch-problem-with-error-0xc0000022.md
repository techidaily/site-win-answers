 1) In Epic Game Launcher, click **Library** .

 2) On the right pane, locate Fortnite, then click **the three dots icon next to Fortnite** and click **VERIFY** .

 3) Once completed, click to run Fortnite to see if it launches properly. If yes, then congrats! If the issue still remains, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: **Run Epic Games Launcher and Fortnite as administrator**

 In some cases, Fortnite won’t launch properly because it is not granted the necessary access to running the game. To make sure the LS-0013 error is not thrown up because of insufficient rights, you should run **Epic Games Launcher** and **Fortnite** as administrator.

Here is how to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator:

 1) On your desktop, right-click on the **Epic Games Launcher icon** and select **Properties** .

 2) Click the **Compatibility**  tab, tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator**  and click **OK** .

 3) Run Fortnite to see if it works without fail. If yes, then you have solved the issue! If the error still happens, you can then run Fortnite**as administrator** , the steps are similar as those for Epic Games Launcher.
