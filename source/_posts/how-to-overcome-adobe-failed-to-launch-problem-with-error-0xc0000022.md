 You can also do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Launch the game again to see if runs smoothly without the error. If yes, then great and enjoy the game! If LS-0013 still pops up, please move on to **Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Verify game integrity

 You may encounter this issue if some files of your game installation are corrupt or have been deleted as a false positive by antivirus programs. If this is the case, you should verify the integrity of game files to fix the issue.

Here is how to verify the integrity of Fortnite:

 1) In Epic Game Launcher, click **Library** .

 2) On the right pane, locate Fortnite, then click **the three dots icon next to Fortnite** and click **VERIFY** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 3) Once completed, click to run Fortnite to see if it launches properly. If yes, then congrats! If the issue still remains, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: **Run Epic Games Launcher and Fortnite as administrator**

 In some cases, Fortnite won’t launch properly because it is not granted the necessary access to running the game. To make sure the LS-0013 error is not thrown up because of insufficient rights, you should run **Epic Games Launcher** and **Fortnite** as administrator.

Here is how to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator:

 1) On your desktop, right-click on the **Epic Games Launcher icon** and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 2) Click the **Compatibility**  tab, tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator**  and click **OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 3) Run Fortnite to see if it works without fail. If yes, then you have solved the issue! If the error still happens, you can then run Fortnite**as administrator** , the steps are similar as those for Epic Games Launcher.

 Once finished, don’t forget to check if the Fortnite**LS-0013** error is resolved.
