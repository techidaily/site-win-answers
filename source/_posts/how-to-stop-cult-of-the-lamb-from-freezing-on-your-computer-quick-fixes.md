## Fix 2 Repair HDD bad sectors

 A bad sector in computing is a disk sector on a disk storage unit that is damaged. Files stored in this sector will be lost or malfunctioned. Therefore, if your game files are located in the bad sector of the drive, it may cause the Cult of the Lamb to crash. Logical bad sectors can be detected and repaired following the steps:

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows search bar and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cmd.jpg)
2. Copy and paste the following command. Remember to replace**e:** with the drive storing your game file.  
`**chkdsk e: /f /r /x**`

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-12_17-17-48.jpg)
3. Hit**Enter** on your keyboard. Then wait for it to run a scan and repair bad sectors for your drive.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-12_15-00-15-1.jpg)

 If it fails to find any bad sector or this fix doesn’t work for you, continue to try the next one.

## Fix 3 Run the game as an administrator

 Running the game as an administrator can ensure that your game gains the system’s full support and maximum resources because it’s considered authorized. So this fix is widely used to ease the game crashing problem. Just check the guide below:

1. Right-click the**Cult of the Lamb.exe** file and choose**Properties** from the pop-up menu.
2. Choose the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick the box**Run this program as an administrator** , and click **Apply**  and **OK**  to save changes.

 That’s it. Now you can run the game in the way you normally do, and it will automatically run as an administrator. Launch the game to see if the crashing issue is solved.

1. Open Steam and click **Library** .
2. Right-click **Cult of the Lamb** and select **Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1494880/17238" target="_top" id="1494880"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1494880" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1494880/17238" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-1.jpg)
3. Select **LOCAL FILES** on the left and click **Verify integrity of game files…**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/skywalker-saga-crash-2.jpg)

 Steam will verify the files of this game for you. Once done, exit the software client and launch it again. Have a test to see if the crashing issue is gone.

## Fix 6 Repair system files

 As problem game files, flawed system files can lead to Cult of the Lamb crashing. Some problem system files (eg. missing or corrupt DLL files) might even affect the system’s running. So you may want to run a quick and thorough scan to see if problems exist.

[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a trusted application offering system repair solutions for years.

 Fortect offers a **60-day money-back** guarantee, so don’t hesitate to contact them if you need any assistance. However, if the crashing of the Cult of the Lamb still persists, check the next solution.

## Fix 7 Add the game to whitelist

 Sometimes antivirus may overprotect your computer by blocking some data transfer which is essential for video games, causing games to crash or freeze.

 If you’re using any antivirus, these tools may have a negative impact on your gaming experience. To eliminate their effect, you can add the game to your antivirus whitelist. If you don’t know how to do it, just google your antivirus’s name and whitelist (eg. McAfee whitelist). Then follow the official guidelines to add Cult of the Lamb to its white list.

## Fix 8 Disable overlay

 It’s reported that some overlay apps may conflict with Cult of the Lamb, producing a crashing or freezing screen. If you’re using overlay software such as Discord or Xbox, disable them temporarily. In addition, some games have a problem pairing with the Steam overlay, so also disable the overlay on Steam with the steps below:

1. Open Steam client.
2. Navigate to the **Steam**  \> **Settings**  \> **In-game** tab.
3. Uncheck **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/stray-not-launching.jpg)

 Relaunch Steam after you have disabled apps and Steam overlay. Open the game to see if the problem is gone.

## Fix 9 Close unnecessary programs

Still no luck? Try this final fix.

 Too many running programs will definitely take up the system resource, leading to game crashes. Sometimes even if you have closed the programs, their background processes are still running hidden from your eyes. To solve this, you can close these processes on Task Manager.

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and click **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/task-manager-1.jpg)
2. Choose the processes consuming too many resources, and then click **End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-13_18-31-13.jpg)
3. Click the **Detail**  tab. Right-click **Stray.exe** and set its priority to **High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/game-stuttering-10.jpg)

 Return to the game to check if the problem is solved. If it fails to tackle the problem, you can try to update your Windows or reinstall the game.
