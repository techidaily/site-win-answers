## Fix 1: Close background programs

 Naraka: Bladepoint is likely to crash when too many programs are running in the background and taking up all the resources. You can shut down the background programs via Task Manager:

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab, look for the processes that are CPU, memory, and network-hogging. Take Chrome here, for example, right-click it then click**End task** .

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphic driver is one of the most common reasons for Naraka: Bladepoint keeps crashing on PC. You may want to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it via Device Manager. If Device Manager fails to detect an available update, you can also search on the manufacturer’s website. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4: Repair system files

 In addition to game files, corrupted system files could also cause Naraka: Bladepoint to crash. You can use the System File Checker tool (sfc /scannow) to look for any critical system issues. This tool can be handy, but most of the time manual repair is required.

## Fix 5: Increase the virtual memory on your PC

 The developer suggests that insufficient virtual memory could interfere with the game’s performance, and lead to the crashing issue. You can check your virtual memory (paging file size) first, then configure the settings if needed.

**To check your virtual memory** :

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Paste**sysdm.cpl** in the box, then click OK.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-sysdm.cpl-.jpg)
3. Go to the**Advanced** tab, under the Performance section, click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/advanced-performance-settings.jpg)
4. Again switch to the**Advanced** tab, under the Virtual memory section, click**Change** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/virtual-memory-change.jpg)
5. Now you’ll see the paging file size on your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**To manually allocate paging file size** :

 If you want to increase your virtual memory to fix the crashing issue, or for a better gaming experience, follow the steps below:

1. UNCHECK the box of**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** , then select**Custom size** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-10_11-54-55.jpg)
2. Use the below formulas to calculate the values you should set:  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

_**1GB = 1024 MB**_  
 _**Initial size (MB) = 1.5 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_  
_**Maximum size (MB) = 3 \* the amount of RAM (GB) on your PC**_
3. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, press the**Windows key** and**R** to invoke the Run box. Then type in**msinfo32** and click**OK** . You’ll find the information in the pop-up window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/run-msinfo32.jpg)
4. Calculate and fill in the**Initial size and Maximum size** , click**Set** then click**OK** . For example, I have 8 GB RAM, so my initial size would be 8\*1024\*1.5=12,288 MB, and my maximum size would be 8\*1024\*3=24576 MB  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/custom-size.jpg)
5. Restart your PC to let the changes take effect.

If your game still crashes, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Keep your system up-to-date

 If your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be compatibility issues which cause the game to crash. Make sure that you always install the available updates. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation if needed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-update.jpg)
4. Restart your PC to let it take effect.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

## Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run.

 By doing a clean boot, you can identify if any background program was interfering with Naraka: Bladepoint and causing the crashing issue.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-40-15.jpg)

 If Naraka: Bladepoint doesn’t crash anymore, this means at least one of the programs you disabled was causing the problem.  
  
**Here’s how to find out which one(s):**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, tick the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox**,** then tick the checkboxes in front of**the first five items** in the list.  
 Then click**Apply** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-53-16.jpg)
3. Reboot your computer and launch the game. If it once again won’t crash, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If it_does_ crash, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Naraka: Bladepoint.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

3. Reboot and try launching Naraka: Bladepoint to see if it still crashes.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with the game.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.
