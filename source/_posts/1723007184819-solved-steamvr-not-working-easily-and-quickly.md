Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.

### Fix 7: Reinstall DayZ

 If none of the fixes works, you may need to reinstall DayZ to fix this issue. To reinstall DayZ:

1. Open Steam and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. **Right-click** DayZ and select **Delete Local Content…** . to uninstall the game.
3. When the uninstalling process completes, click the game name within your Library to reinstall the game.
