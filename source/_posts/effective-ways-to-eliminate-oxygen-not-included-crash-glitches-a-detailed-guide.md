You can update your video driver either manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update –** You can update your video driver manually by **going to the manufacturer’s website for your video card** , and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact video card, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. Download and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1b9f02530c.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
