 Once applying the changes, you can relaunch Zoom and see if the camera is able to work correctly. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

 When other programs are utilizing your camera, Zoom may lose control of your camera and therefore cannot start a video. To make sure there’s no interference with your webcam, try closing unncessary programs especially those telecommunication apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Discord or Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

3. Select the**Video** tab. Then choose the correct camera from the drop-down menu.

### Fix 4 – Update your camera driver

 If the camera driver on your PC is faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Zoom cannot start video issue. To keep your camera working at the best performance, you should update its driver to the latest.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update the driver manually. Just visit the website of your camera manufacturer, download the latest driver that’s right for your operating system, and install them manually.

 But if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged webcam driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you‘ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
