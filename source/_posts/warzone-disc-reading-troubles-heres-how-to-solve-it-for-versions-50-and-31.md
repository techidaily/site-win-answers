 After installing all the system updates, restart your PC and check if the error persists.

 If this fix doesn’t help you, simply move on to the next one below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers

 We always recommend gamers to keep their GPU drivers up to date for the best performance and minimum issues. If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your graphics driver, you need to check it now.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can try to update the driver manually. First go to the manufacturer’s website:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

 Then search your model and find the correct driver installer that fits your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with**Driver Easy** . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 3: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 In some cases, it might be your antivirus that’s causing the hassle. To prevent your antivirus from interfering with the game, you can disable it temporarily and see how things go.

Here’s an example of how you can disable Windows Security:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to enter the Windows settings menu. Click**Update & Security** .

Now you can restart Warzone and check if the game loads as expected.

 If disabling the antivirus doesn’t help, turn it back on and continue to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Disable the Sonic Studio Virtual Mixer

**Sonic Studio Virtual Mixer** is an audio suite that comes with some high-end ASUS motherboards. According to some gamers, this component could be the culprit of the Disc Read Error in Warzone, so you can try to check and disable this device and see how it works.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** to invoke the**Run** box. Type or paste**mmsys.cpl** and click**OK** .

### Fix 5: Delete Cache files

[Some users](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/f7ga0o/disc%5Fread%5Ferror%5Fsolution%5Ffor%5Fpc%5Fis%5Fhere/) shared that they managed to fix the issue by**deleting specific cache files** . According to the feedback, this appears to be a less painful solution as it re-downloads a small portion of game content. You can try the same and see if this helps.

#### Delete these cache files

| **File** **Name**               | **Folder** **Name**                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Every file ends with**.dcache** | C:Program Files\\Call of Duty Modern Warfare\\main |
| **ppsod.dat**                   | Documents\\Call of Duty Modern Warfare\\players    |
| **adv\_options.ini**            | Documents\\Call of Duty Modern Warfare\\players    |

 Once done, you can start Warzone as you normally would. It should download updates and start optimizing shaders.

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 6:**Rebuild your game files**

 The error could indicate an integrity issue with your game files. You can delete the likely corrupted ones and re-download them using the Scan & Repair feature.

 This fix might need you to re-download a large part of game content. A safer option would be reinstalling the whole game. You should choose the measure that suits you the best.

1. Open your Blizzard Battle.net client. In the left pane, select**Call of Duty: MW** . Click**Options** and select**Show in Explorer** .
