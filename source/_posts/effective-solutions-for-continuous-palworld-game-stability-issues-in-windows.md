## Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord Stability Issues Corrected - Solutions Inside

Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord keeps crashing to the desktop? Don’t panic. Here’re 5 solutions to try.

## 5 solutions to try

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Increase virtual memory](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Before you proceed,**perform a restart** on your computer first. A reboot will refresh the operating system and fix almost any software-related glitches.

### Solution 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 Files of your game installation might get corrupt, or be deleted as a false positive by antivirus. If this happens to you, you may run into Bannerlord crashing issues.

 To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Steam and click **LIBRARY** .

**2)**  Right-click**Mount & Blade II: Bannerlordand** and select **Properties.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-01_14-41-15-2.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **LOCAL FILES**  tab, and then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

**4)** Wait for the scans to be complete, then relaunch the game.

If Mount & Blade 2 still crashes, try the next solution.

### Solution 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game issues is a missing or outdated graphics driver. So, if you’re encountering any issues with Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord, such as game crashes and lags, try updating your graphics driver. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-01_14-21-20.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Relaunch the game.

If the Bannerlord is still unplayable, continue with the next solution.

### Solution 3: Reinstall the game

 If your game was working previously but is now crashing and you have completed verifying the game files with no results, try this next.

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the Steam icon on the taskbar, and then select **Exit** .

### Solution 4: Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive.

 If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the virtual memory is not sufficient to save temporary files, applications running on your PC might fail.

 In this case, follow the instructions below to increase the size of your virtual memory:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**
