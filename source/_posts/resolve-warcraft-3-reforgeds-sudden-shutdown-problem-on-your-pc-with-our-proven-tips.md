### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If you’re an avid gamer, you must know how important a graphics card driver means, and how an outdated or corrupt graphics card driver causes your game to crash, lag or load forever, etc. Therefore, you should always check the current driver version and keep your graphics card driver up-to-date.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver: **manually** and **automatically** .

#### Option 1:**Manual driver update**

 Graphics card manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs and improve game performance. You can find your graphics card driver and download the latest version from its official website:

* [AMD Driver Download](http://www.amd.com/drivers)
* [NVIDIA Driver Download](http://www.nvidia.com/drivers)
* [Intel Driver Download](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

 Then download the driver that is compatible with your Windows OS, and manually install it in your computer.

#### Option 2:**Automatic driver update**

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

3. Click the Update button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the FREE version), then install the driver manually on your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Stop overclocking

 Overclocking your video cards is not supported and may cause**performance or crash issues in StarCraft 2** . To undo the overclocking, you’ll need to enter the CMOS and BIOS settings of the system and reverse all the changes back to default.

 To disable overclocking of your Nvidia GPU in a simple way, you can try its**Debug Mode** :

_Note: This method applies only to the_ non-reference model cards_._

1. Right-click your desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel.  
![Open NVIDIA control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NVIDIA-control-panel.jpg)
2. Expand the**Help** menu, and check the**Debug Mode** option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![debug-mode-nvidia](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Debug-Mode.jpg)

 This will help you downclock any factory overclocked graphics card to Nvidia reference clock speeds. Although generally speaking, overclocking provides better performance in games and graphics-intensive applications, it can sometimes cause crashing issues and shorten the lifespan of your graphics card.

### Fix 5: Reset your Starcraft 2 in-game options

 Sometimes Starcraft 2 will fail to recognize your graphics driver since it’s been changed or whatsoever. Resetting your in-game options can always do the trick if this is the culprit of your Starcraft 2 crashing.

1. Open your Blizzard launcher.
2. Click![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/options-1.png) and select**Game settings** .
3. Scroll down to Starcraft 2 and click the**Reset In-Game Options** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Click **Reset** .
5. Click **Done** , then relaunch the game.

 This will revert the game video options to default and allow you to load in.

 If this doesn’t work, you can restore the driver settings to default by referring to **[How to Reset Video Driver Settings](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/24142)**  .

### Fix 6: Make an exception for Starcraft 2 in your Antivirus app

 If you have any third-party antivirus app installed, you might need to uninstall it temporarily or you can try **adding Starcraft 2 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 If you don’t know how to do it, you can consult your antivirus documentation for instructions or search **How to Add Antivirus Exclusions to \[name of your antivirus app\]** .

1. Navigate to the game directory and right-click the SC2.exe file.
2. Select**Properties** on the pop-up menu
3. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab.
4. Check the**Run this program as administrator** box.

### Fix 8: Set Affinity for Starcraft 2

 Most users have reported that Starcraft 2 can’t utilize all of the CPU cores. So, the best fix for this is to set the affinity for the game from the Task Manager.

1. Start your Starcraft 2.
2. Press**Alt + Tab** on your keyboard to switch to the Windows 10 desktop when the game starts.
3. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.
4. Navigate to the**Details** tab in the Task Manager window.
5. Look for the Starcraft 2 process in the list provided, then right-click it and select**Set Affinity** .
6. In the new window, uncheck one of the CPUs.
7. Click**OK** and then go back to your game.

 If this temporary method works for you, you’ll need to repeat these steps every time you start your game.

2. Select the Starcraft 2 tab and select**Options** then**Game Settings** .
3. Click**Additional command line arguments for SC2** .
