## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 Although Overlays are handy, sometimes they may interfere with the game. According to some PC players, it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with HLL. Try disabling Steam Overlay for HLL and see if the game crashes again. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** .**right-click** on _Hell Let Loose_ . Then select **Properties** .

 Launch HLL and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 In order to get a better FPS, many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card. However, overclocking often crashes the game.
