4. Download and install it correctly.

### Fix 4: Turn off the Xbox game bar

2. Click**Gaming** .
3. Go to the**Game bar** tab, make sure the toggle is off.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-15_14-33-30.jpg)
4. Relaunch the game and check.

### Fix 5: Shut down unnecessary apps

 If you can play the game, but it’s lagging and viewers get spikes, shutting down unnecessary background applications is a good option. It’s because Stream requires some CPU power too, the less other stuff, the more power for Cyberpunk 2077.
