## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and **you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Driver Easy Scan Now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Now.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to a device to automatically download the correct version of their driver, then you can manually install the driver (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)
4. Restart your PC after you finished updating your graphics driver.

 See if the latest graphics driver stops the Dirt 5 from crashing. If not, don’t worry. Try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Verify the game files
