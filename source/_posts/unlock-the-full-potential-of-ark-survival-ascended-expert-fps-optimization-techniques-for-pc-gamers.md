## Eliminate Game Disruptions: A Definitive Guide to Fixing Persistent FIFA 20 PC Crashes - Learn the Essential Techniques

Does your FIFA 20 crash on PC so often that it is all but unplayable? If the answer is “yes,” don’t panic – you’re not alone. Although this problem can be quite tricky sometimes, there’re still a few general fixes for you to try. Now let’s dig in and see what’s what.

## Check your PC specs first

 First of all, check your PC specs to verify if they meet the system requirements for FIFA 20\. This is always the prerequisite act before you download and install a new game. Suppose you forget to take this step and go directly for the game, then oops – you aren’t even able to launch it! What a desperate moment. Trust me, I’ve been through this before and asked myself tons of times whether I should simply give up the game or kick that old machine to the curb and then buy a new one. Whichever way I chose, I would surely lose something important: pleasure for the former, and money for the latter.

In case you don’t know how, here’s the guidance:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **dxdiag** and click **OK** .

 2) In the **DirectX Diagnostic Tool** window, on the **System** tab, you can see the make and model of your computer. Just take note of the following parameters: **Operating System** , **Processor** , **Memory** , and **DirectX Version** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Ignore the specs listed here. This computer is not used for gaming.

 3) Go to the **Display** tab so you can view the information about your **graphics card** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-437.png)

 4) If you also want to know the screen resolution of your monitor, right-click a blank area of your desktop to open the context menu. Then click **Display settings** .

### Fix 1:**Update your device drivers**

 Your crashing issue in FIFA 20 may be caused by outdated or corrupt device drivers (especially graphics card drivers). If you’re not sure whether all your device drivers are up-to-date, you should check.

 Updating drivers can also fix**DirectX errors** in some cases.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, one device at a time. But this takes a lot of time and patience, and if any of your drivers do happen to be out of date, you’ll need to manually update them, which is difficult and risky. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-439.png)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 If you have any problems using Driver Easy to update your driver, please feel free to email us at **<support@drivereasy.com>** . We are always here to help.

 If you still have random crashes with FIFA 20, you should give the next fix a try.

### **Fix 2: Roll back your graphics card driver**

 If updating drivers didn’t resolve your problem, then maybe you should roll it back to a previous version that appears more stable. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-212.png)

 2) In the Device Manager window, double-click on the **Display adapters** node to expand its drop-down list. Then right-click on your graphics card (the one used to run the game) and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-933.png)

 3) Click**Roll Back Driver** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-938.png)

 If the **Roll Back Driver** option is grayed out, that means there’s no driver to roll back to. In this case you’ll have to try other fixes.

 4) Choose one of the reasons based on your own situation and click **Yes** .

<a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754" border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-218.png)

5) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Now run FIFA 20 and check whether your crashing problem still exists. If it does, then please proceed to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update Windows operating system

 This fix should be helpful especially when your Windows operating system hasn’t been updated for a long time. You should first check for updates, then perform them if there’s any.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open the **Settings** window. Then click **Updates & Security** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496" border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-141.png)

 2) On the **Windows Update** tab, in the results pane, click **Check for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-947.png)

 3) Wait for the system to search for available updates online. If there’s indeed a pending update, then Windows will automatically download the update and install it. Once the process completes, restart your computer for the changes to be fully implemented.

 Now launch FIFA 20 again and see whether it keeps crashing. If it does, then move on to the Fix 4 below.

---

### Fix 4: Change DirectX settings

 When your FIFA 20 crashes with an error message mentioning “DirectX,” you’re most likely having a DirectX issue that requires you to change related settings of the game.

1) Navigate to the game folder using the following path:

 C:\Users\<username>\Documents\FIFA 20

 2) Open the**fifasetup.ini** file with Notepad or other tools alike.

 3) In the pop-up window, press**Ctrl** and**F** simultaneously on your keyboard to invoke the**Find** dialog box.

 Type**DIRECTX\_SELECT = 1** and click**Find Next** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-866.png)

 If your**fifasetup.ini** file is already set to**0** when you first open it, then try changing it to**1** instead.

 Run FIFA 20 and check whether it continues to crash. If it does, try out the next fix then.

---

### Fix 5: Adjust settings in NVIDIA Control Panel

 Make sure your computer is using the correct graphics card to run FIFA 20\. This is particularly important when you have two graphics cards mounted on one PC. Besides, you can fine-tune certain settings for FIFA 20 in NVIDIA Control Panel in order to reduce the risk of crashing.

 1) Right-click an empty area on your desktop to open the context menu. Then select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-903.png)

 2) In the NVIDIA Control Panel window, click**Manage 3D settings** in the left pane. On the right panel, go to the**Program Settings** tab and click**Add** to select FIFA 20 (navigate to your game file and double-click it). Then, you can customize settings for FIFA 20 based on your liking. For example, you can set**Vertical sync** to**On** .

 On completion, click**Apply** to save the changes you’ve made.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-913.png)

3) Exit NVIDIA Control Panel, restart your computer, then launch FIFA 20.

If you continue to face the crashing problem, please move on to Fix 6.

---

### Fix 6: Repair corrupted system files

 It’s possible that some of the system files in your PC have been damaged and hence gave rise to crashing in FIFA 20\. To check for such problems, here are at least two things you should do:

1. **[Scan with System File Checker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Scan with dism.exe](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### 1\. Scan with System File Checker

 System File Checker (sfc) is a Windows utility that identifies and repairs corrupted system files:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**  to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-182.png)

 2) When Windows asks for permission to make changes to your device, click **Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-63.png)

 3) In the Command Prompt, type the following command (**note** that there’s a space between sfc and /):

sfc /scannow

 After you finish entering the command, hit **Enter** on your keyboard. Then the sfc tool will begin to scan all system files and repair the corrupted or missing ones.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-183.png)

 4) Wait until the verification process completes. Then **restart** your computer for the changes to take effect.

 If, after running sfc you still experience the crashing issue, try running dism.exe as described below.

#### 2\. Scan with dism.exe

 Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is an in-built Windows tool that can identify if your Windows installation is corrupt, and repair it if it is:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**  to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-182.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-182.png)

 If prompted for consent, click **Yes** .

 2) In Command Prompt, type the following command (**note** that there’s a space to the left of each slash “/”):

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 After that, hit **Enter** on your keyboard. Then the DISM tool will begin to scan for any problems and try to fix them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-165.png)

 Wait for the process to complete. Then, reboot your computer, launch FIFA 20, and wait to see if it keeps crashing. If it does, try out Fix 7.

---

### Fix 7: Close unnecessary programs

 Chances are that some of the programs running on your PC is clashing with FIFA 20\. Although this kind of software conflicts doesn’t come up very often, it’s still worth checking. For instance, you can completely shut down some overlays and then wait to see if the crashing issue reoccurs. If you did notice one or more programs that might potentially conflict with FIFA 20, uninstall them from your PC or at least try to disable them while the game is running.

 You should also check the quarantine or blacklist of your antivirus in case it mistakenly classifies the game as a threat to your PC and prevents it from running properly. If your antivirus is truly the root cause, **disable it temporarily** while you’re playing FIFA 20\. However, you should be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled because your computer system is susceptible to security risks at that moment.

 If, after restoring the game files mistakenly deleted by your antivirus the game is still crashing, you should try to download and install it once again. However, make sure you turn off the antivirus temporarily during the reinstall process of FIFA 20.

### Fix 8: Wait for more game updates

 Lastly, there’s a chance that your problem is triggered by technical issues of FIFA 20 (such as an unforeseen issue in the game’s code). In that case, you should simply wait for more game updates to fix the problem. Or you can contact **[EA](https://help.ea.com/en/contact-us/)**  (the game developer) and see if they can offer you any assistance.
