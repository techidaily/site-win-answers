 Video games nowadays are becoming more graphically demanding. So if Madden 22 just won’t work on your computer, you should make sure the machine is up for handling the game.

Here are the minimum requirements for Madden NFL 22:

| **OS**        | Windows 10 64-bit                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Athlon X4 880K 4GHz, Core i3-6100 3.7GHz |
| **Memory**    | 8GB                                      |
| **Graphics**  | Radeon RX 460, NVIDIA GTX 660            |
| **Storage**   | 50GB                                     |

 If your computer specs are more than enough to run the game, the cause may be related to device drivers, antivirus or something else. Read on to more solutions below.

### Fix 2 – Update your device drivers

 The Madden 22 not working issue may be caused by the faulty or outdated device drivers on your computer. If you haven’t updated your device drivers for a long time, definitely do it now as it will guarantee you a smooth and pleasant gaming experience.

There are mainly two ways to update your drivers:

**Manually** – You need to visit the hardware manufacturers’ websites and search for the exact model of your device. Then download the latest correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system. Once done, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it manually.

**Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. Go to the Madden 22 installation folder. Then click the executable file and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-14.jpg)

### Fix 4 – Repair the game files

 Missing or faulty game files will also prevent Madden 22 from working properly. To see if that’s the case, you could perform a quick scan and repair of the game files. Below we’ll show you how to do this on **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and[**Epic Games Launcher**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-3-1.jpg)

 After the process finishes, restart Madden 22 to test the issue. If it’s still not working, try the next fix below.

### Fix 5 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 If you’ve installed antivirus programs to protect your computer from potential threats, they can sometimes be overprotective and mistakenly block your games like Madden 22 from working.

 To determine whether it’s the culprit, you should temporarily disable your antivirus. If the problem is fixed, you need to**whitelist Madden 22 in the anti-virus programs** so that you can use both without conflicts. Just select the software you’re using and follow the guides:

* [McAfee](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/application-control-8.2.0-product-guide-windows/page/GUID-3205E6EF-C5FC-458C-B326-99E9679E291B.html)
* [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/consumer/support/answer/13427/)
* [Avast](https://support.avast.com/en-sg/article/Antivirus-scan-exclusions)
* [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/kaspersky-add-exclusion/14765/#:~:text=Open%20the%20settings%20Kaspersky%20Internet,scope%20in%20Kaspersky%20Internet%20Security.)

 If disabling the antivirus doesn’t give you luck, then it is not to blame.

 You may consider reinstalling Madden 22 as the last resort if all the methods above can’t help. A fresh reinstallation can usually resolve the stubborn issues during your previous installation, but please remember to**delete all the remaining game files** after you uninstall the game.
