Some also**receive some error codes** , preventing them from enjoying the gameplay. If you’re one of them, don’t fret! We’ve gathered some methods for you to identify the root cause and resolve your problems.

## Before going any further…

 Before we dive into troubleshooting, let’s begin by ensuring your system is up to the challenge of running Starfield. Bethesda’s epic space exploration game offers a breathtaking experience, but it requires a certain level of hardware capability to truly shine.

#### Minimum System Requirements

 First, make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements as provided by Bethesda.

| **Additional Notes** | SSD Required(Solid-state Drive)            |

#### Recommended System Requirements

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Update Windows

## 3\. Disable antivirus and firewall

 Your firewall and antivirus are diligent gatekeepers, which is great for overall security. However, they can occasionally misinterpret Starfield’s actions as threats. By turning them off briefly, you can check if they’re blocking the game’s launch.

 _Note: Only disable them temporarily for testing, and remember to re-enable them afterward. Otherwise, your system could be put at risk._

To temporarily disable the Windows Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.

## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

 To make sure those files are intact, you can use the **System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”
