## Fix 1: Check your credentials

 When you’re having trouble logging in to Steam, the first thing you should always do is to make sure your credentials are correct. This may sound silly, but it does work. Make sure you’re**logging in with your username, not your email** . For password, you can type it down somewhere and paste it in Steam to make sure it’s correct.

 Players also found some minor bugs in the Steam login system that prevent users from logging in. Although they’re yet to be fixed, you can try these workarounds to see if they help:

* Try**typing your username in uppercase** , no matter if it was uppercase or lowercase.
* **Use a new password that contains purely letters and numbers** (aka only 1-9 and a-z are allowed). Avoid using symbols in your password will make sure that Steam is reading your password right, as some users found out the bugs are keystroke-related for different keyboards.

 If you’ve checked your credentials and everything looks fine, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2: Check Steam server status

 Another quick fix is to see if the problem is with Steam server instead of user-end. You can check the server status on[Steam stats page](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/) , where you’ll see the number of real-time concurrent players. If the server is down, there should be a sharp decline on the current users.

If the server is working just fine, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Log in from a web browser

 Sometimes the problem is with the Steam client instead of your account. If you can’t log in via the Steam client, try the web browser.

 Go to the[Steam login page](https://store.steampowered.com/login) and try logging in. If you can log in now, then we know for sure that the problem was with your Steam client. Jump to[Fix 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to fix your Steam client.

 If you’re having trouble logging in from the browser, try disabling the browser extension one by one and then logging in to test if anything was causing the problem.

If this doesn’t work, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Clear Steam cache

 Broken cache files can prevent you from logging in to Steam via the Steam client. You can delete the local files to get it fixed. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows key** and**E** to open the File Explorer.
2. Navigate to**C:\\Users\\\[Your Username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Steam** .
3. Delete everything in the Steam folder. These are all temporary files so you won’t have to worry .
4. Run the Steam client and try logging in.

 After clearing the cache files, your Steam client won’t remember the auto-filled credentials and it’s like when you first installed it. Your account and game files won’t be affected. If this doesn’t give you luck, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Test your internet connection

 If you’ve tried the above fixes but nothing worked, then the problem is likely with your PC, not Steam. You can test your internet connection first to see you can connect to the Steam server. Here’s a few things you can do:

* **Power cycle your router and modem** . Unplug the power cables from your router and your modem, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then plug the cables back into both devices. When your Internet is working again, check if you can log in to Steam.
* If you use Wi-Fi which is connected to multiple devices, **turn off Wi-Fi on the devices you don’t currently need to use.** Overcrowding can slow your connection down and may lead to other connection issues.  
 (Side note,**using** **a wired connection** generally provides a more stable connection for gaming.)
* Google “Internet speed test” and pick a tool to**test your Internet speed** . When your Internet connection is unreasonably slow, consider contacting your Internet provider for help.

 If your Internet connection is valid but you still get the login error from Steam, try the next fix.

## Fix 6: Check your firewall and antivirus

 Your firewall or antivirus, if you use any, can block Steam if it thinks Steam is risky. The connection to the Steam server could be interfered with, so you keep getting login errors. In this case, you can allow Steam through your firewall and/or your antivirus.

**To check if your firewall is blocking Steam** :

1. Press the**Windows key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**control panel** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-19-54.jpg)
3. Select**View by: Small icons** . Click**Windows Defender Firewall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-21-09.jpg)
4. Click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-25-19.jpg)
5. Scroll down and you should see**Steam.exe** , and other Steam related programs. You can**tick the box of Private** to allow Steam through the firewall when you’re using a private network. Click**OK** to save.

 If you didn’t find Steam in the exception list above, you’ll need to **manually add it to the list then allow it through the firewall** . Here’s how:

1. Click**Change Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-40-16.jpg)
2. Click**Allow another app** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-41-32.jpg)
3. Click**Browse** then navigate to the Steam local folder. The default path is**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-42-30.jpg)
4. Select**Steam.exe** , then click**Open** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-43-21.jpg)
5. If you want to add other Steam-related programs to the exception list, you can repeat Step 3 and 4\. Once you’re done, select all the programs you wish to add to the list, then click**Add** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-45-12.jpg)
6. **Tick the box of Private** to allow Steam.exe (and other programs if you need) through the firewall when you’re using a private network. Click**OK** to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-31_10-35-52.jpg)

 The steps for your antivirus software should be similar. You’ll need to add the Steam executable file or select the Steam client, then add it to the whitelist of your antivirus.

 It’s also possible to disable your firewall/antivirus to test the login errors. But we don’t recommend doing so as it can be quite dangerous and expose your PC to risks. If you want to give it a try, be extra cautious and don’t download anything from the internet when your PC isn’t under protection.

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 7: Disable background programs

 Programs running in the background may have been interfering with Steam so you couldn’t log in to Steam. Here’s a[list](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1F39-DCB4-FF28-5748) of programs that could possibly cause the issue. If you suspect any of the programs on your PC, you can close it in the Task Manager then try to log into Steam. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab, look for the processes that you think could be problematic. Right-click it then select**End task** .

## Fix 8: Update your network driver

 If you’ve tried the above fixes but nothing worked, you can try updating your network driver. An outdated or faulty driver can cause many random errors. You may want to update your network adapter driver to make sure it’s functioning properly

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter:**manually or automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update the network driver via Device Manager. Note that Windows may not be able to give you the latest available update. You can go to the manufacturer’s website, and search for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only the driver that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged network driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it(you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

Restart your PC for the new drivers to take effect.
