## Fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. [**Rule out software conflicts**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Run SWTOR in Admin mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Delete the Bitraider folder](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Rule out software conflicts

 The SWTOR not launching problem can be caused by a previous task session that didn’t end properly or the BitRaider background downloader that interferes with the game. To fix this, simply open the Task Manager and end the SWTOR Launcher task and BitRaider processes:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl, Shift, and Esc keys** at the same time to open Task Manager.

**2)** Right-click**SWTOR Launcher** and select**End task** .

 Then, repeat this step and kill all the**BitRaider-related processes,** such as**BitRaider Distribution Web Client** and**BitRaider Support Service Core** .

 Running third-party programs in the background can also interfere with your game and lead to issues like this (_especially overlay programs_ ). So, if you’re running multiple programs while gaming, please close them to rule out software conflicts and free up resources for your game.

 If your**antivirus** is running, temporarily disable it and check if the problem persists. This is because antivirus sometimes mistakenly identifies the game login module as a security threat.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 If SWTOR works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

If SWTOR still won’t start, read on and try the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Run SWTOR in Admin mode

 If SWTOR doesn’t have permissions for certain game files on your system under a standard user mode, it may not run properly. Try the following steps to grant the program administrator privileges:

**1)** Right-click the**SWTOR desktop icon** and select**Open File Location** .

**2)** Right-click the **.exe file** and select **Properties** .

**3)** Click the **Compatibility** tab and check **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **OK** .

**4)** Relaunch your game to see if this helped.

If this doesn’t work for you, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is the most important component when it comes to determining gaming performance. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure you update your graphics driver. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**
