Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press Win (the Windows logo key) and type Epic Games. In the search results, select**Run as administrator** .

### Fix 3: Launch Hitman 3 from game folder

 The game not launching error might come from the game launcher. Some gamers reported on[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/l1qlc7/cant%5Flaunch%5Fthe%5Fgame%5Fat%5Fall%5Fon%5Fepic/) that when they failed to start Hitman 3 from Epic Games launcher, one possible workaround is to launch it using the**hitman3.exe** file in the game folder. So you can try this trick and see how things go.

 If you can’t launch Hitman 3 directly from the game folder, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 It’s also very likely that the issue is driver-related, which means**a faulty or outdated GPU driver crashes your game** the second you start it. If you haven’t checked for graphics driver updates, definitely do it now as it could save you tons of trouble.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Aside from drivers, it’s also important to keep your system up to date, which means you should make sure all the system updates are installed, as they usually provide more than just some minor bug fixes.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .

4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 After getting all the system updates, restart your gaming rig and check if Hitman 3 works now.

### Fix 6: Check if it’s a server issue

 If you’ve tried all the methods above and none seem to work, then maybe it’s your fault at all. After the game was launched, there’re lots of complaints that the carry over server is down and the game is not connecting. So you might need to be patient before a hotfix is released.
