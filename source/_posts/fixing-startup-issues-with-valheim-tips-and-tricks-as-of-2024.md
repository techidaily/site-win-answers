### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 One of the most common causes of lags during gameplay is the faulty or incompatible graphics driver. If Dota 2 starts lagging after you updated the graphics driver, you’ll need to **[roll back the driver to the previous version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; if you haven’t made any changes to the driver, then **[try updating it to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Roll back your graphics driver to the previous version

 To roll back your graphics driver to the previous version, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

**2)** Enter**devmgmt.msc** , then hit the**Enter** key.

 If this didn’t help, then move on and try **[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Update your graphics driver

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
