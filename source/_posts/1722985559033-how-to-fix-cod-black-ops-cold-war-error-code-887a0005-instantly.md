<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2: Scan and repair game files

 The not launching might indicate**an integrity issue** with your game files. You can follow these steps to check and repair any missing or corrupted files:

1. Open your**Blizzard Battle.net** client. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: BOCW** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-verify.jpg)
2. Click**Options** and select**Scan and Repair** . Then wait until the checking finishes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
You can now launch Black Ops Cold War and see if it’s working.

 If this method doesn’t help your case, simply check out the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The game-not-launching issue tends to be graphics-related. In other words, you could be using**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . If you can’t remember the last time you updated your GPU driver, definitely do it now.

 Both[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-game-ready-driver/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-20-11-1) had released driver optimized for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. See below for update instructions.

 Of course you can update manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ), then search, download and install the graphics driver step by step. But if you don’t like playing with device drivers, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do these automatically:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and check if Black Ops Cold War is working now.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

#### Windows 10

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-7-install-updates-5.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your PC and try to launch Black Ops Cold War.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, simply continue to the next one.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/afterburner.jpg)

MSI Afterburner

 While overclocking is surely a zero-cost benefit, it can also be the trigger of system instability. And according to Activision, Black Ops Cold War does not get along well with overclocking utilities. So if you’re using overclocking software, such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Razer Cortex** or have enabled overclocking in BIOS settings, try stopping that and see if it allows you to start the game.

 If you’re not overclocking in the first place, you can try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Launch Black Ops Cold War in DirectX 11

 Some veterans reported that they managed to get Black Ops Cold War working by using**DirectX 11** . So you can try the same and see how it goes.

Here’re the steps:

1. Open your Blizzard Battle.net client.
2. From the left menu, select**Call of Duty: BOCW** . Click**Options** and select**Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-d11-1.jpg)
3. Check the box next to**Additional command line arguments** . In the input box, type or paste**\-d3d11** (note the dash). Then click**Done** to apply the changes.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-d11-2.jpg)

Now you can check if Black Ops Cold War is working properly.

### Fix 7: Check if your system is corrupted

 If none of the fixes work for you, it could mean that your system is not working properly. In some cases, it’d be some faulty settings or corrupted system files. Either way, you can run a scan with a system repair tool.
