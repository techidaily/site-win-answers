### Fix 2 – Update your device drivers

 The Madden 22 not working issue may be caused by the faulty or outdated device drivers on your computer. If you haven’t updated your device drivers for a long time, definitely do it now as it will guarantee you a smooth and pleasant gaming experience.

There are mainly two ways to update your drivers:

**Manually** – You need to visit the hardware manufacturers’ websites and search for the exact model of your device. Then download the latest correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system. Once done, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it manually.

**Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. Go to the Madden 22 installation folder. Then click the executable file and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-14.jpg)
2. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** to save the changes.

See if the issue persists. If yes, continue to the next solution.

### Fix 4 – Repair the game files

 Missing or faulty game files will also prevent Madden 22 from working properly. To see if that’s the case, you could perform a quick scan and repair of the game files. Below we’ll show you how to do this on **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and[**Epic Games Launcher**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

1. Launch your Steam client and select the**Library** tab.

2. Right-click Madden 22 from the list and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Local Files** tab and click**Verify integrity of game files** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

### Fix 5 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 If you’ve installed antivirus programs to protect your computer from potential threats, they can sometimes be overprotective and mistakenly block your games like Madden 22 from working.

 To determine whether it’s the culprit, you should temporarily disable your antivirus. If the problem is fixed, you need to**whitelist Madden 22 in the anti-virus programs** so that you can use both without conflicts. Just select the software you’re using and follow the guides:

* [McAfee](https://docs.mcafee.com/bundle/application-control-8.2.0-product-guide-windows/page/GUID-3205E6EF-C5FC-458C-B326-99E9679E291B.html)
* [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/consumer/support/answer/13427/)
* [Avast](https://support.avast.com/en-sg/article/Antivirus-scan-exclusions)
* [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/kaspersky-add-exclusion/14765/#:~:text=Open%20the%20settings%20Kaspersky%20Internet,scope%20in%20Kaspersky%20Internet%20Security.)

 If disabling the antivirus doesn’t give you luck, then it is not to blame.

 You may consider reinstalling Madden 22 as the last resort if all the methods above can’t help. A fresh reinstallation can usually resolve the stubborn issues during your previous installation, but please remember to**delete all the remaining game files** after you uninstall the game.
