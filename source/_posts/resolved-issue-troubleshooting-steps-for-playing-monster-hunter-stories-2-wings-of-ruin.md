### Then, update your graphics card driver and HP monitor driver

You can choose to update your device drivers through**Device Manager**to let Windows detect and install the updates automatically. But Microsoft can’t not always detect the update for your device drivers. Instead, you can **manually download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website**.**Alternatively**, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics card driver and monitor driver manually, you can do it **automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. See how:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
