## Before getting started

 Before moving on to the fixes, you need to make sure that your computer meets the minimum hardware and OS requirements to launch the game.

| **OS**        | Windows 10 64-Bit                                       |

| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space                                   |

**MINIMUM** System Requirements

To check your system information, you can:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key + R** together on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**dxdiag** and hit**Enter** .

## Fix 1: Allow your game through Windows Firewall

 Sometimes Windows Security may block your game from launching. So you should manually add your game to the list of allowed apps to prevent it from being blocked.

To do so, you can:

 1) In the **Search**  box, type **windows security**  and click **Windows Security**  from the results.

![allow  an app through controlled folder access FIFA 21 not launching](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-security-1.png)

 2) Select **Virus & threat protection**  from the left pane. Scroll down and under the **Ransomware protection**  section, click **Manage ransomware protection** .

![allow  an app through controlled folder access FIFA 21 not launching](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/manage-ransomware-protection-1200x684.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Switch the **Controlled folder access**  setting to **On** . When a window pops up asking “**Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device** “, click **Yes** .  
 Then click **Allow an app through Controlled folder access** .

![allow  an app through controlled folder access FIFA 21 not launching](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/allow-an-app-through-controlled-folder-access-1200x684.png)

 4) Click **Add an allowed app** **\> Browse all apps** .

![allow  an app through controlled folder access FIFA 21 not launching](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/allow-an-app-through-controlled-folder-access-2-1-1200x684.png)

 5) Then navigate to the game’s installation folder and select**FIFA 21.exe** , also**FIFA 21 trial.exe & FIFAconfig.exe** (only if you have them).

 Also, if you’re using any antivirus software like Avast, AVG, you’re supposed to disable them before you launch your game. Because there is a possibility that this antivirus software is in conflict with your game launching.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 When you have problems launching a game, you need to check if you’re using an outdated or faulty graphics driver. As drivers can greatly impact the system’s performance. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your graphics driver, definitely do it now as it may fix your issue immediately.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-fifa-21-not-launching/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics drivers

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers** (recommended)

 Manually updating graphics drivers does take some time and patience. Also if you encounter other issues related to driver updates while playing the game in the future, you’ll again have to bother downloading and installing the latest drivers on your own. So to save you time, we highly recommend using Driver Easy as your great pick for driver updates.

 Driver Easy is a useful tool that will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

Here’s how you can update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)
