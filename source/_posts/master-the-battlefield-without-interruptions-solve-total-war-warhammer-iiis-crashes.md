![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 When the verifying process is completed, launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this fix works. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Aliens: Fireteam Elite releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by the Steam client, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## 5\. Disable steam overlay

 Overlays are handy, but sometimes they may interfere with the game. Some PC gamers report that it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with the game.

 You can try disabling Steam Overlay for Aliens: Fireteam Elite and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Aliens: Fireteam Elite_ . Then select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Nvidia GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Disable real-time protection from your antivirus software

 The real-time protection feature in some 3rd party antivirus software would block the game files, and this may lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application, and turn off the real-time protection feature. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Run Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.
