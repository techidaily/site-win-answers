3. Once you’ve installed the available updates, restart your computer and check if Spellbreak crashes again.

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  system updates, repeat these steps until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 If updating your system doesn’t give you any luck, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2: Verify your game files

 The crash might indicate**an integrity issue with your game files** . If that’s the case, Spellbreak will crash constantly in some situations.

You can follow these steps to check your game files:

1. Open your**Epic Games Launcher** . From the left menu, select**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/epic-games-launcher-library.jpg)

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of this error is**corrupted or outdated graphics drivers** . So you should definitely try updating your drivers before trying anything more complicated. GPU manufacturers keep releasing new drivers all the time, improving performance and compatibility with new titles. That’s exactly why we recommend to always use the latest driver.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To manually update your graphics driver, you can first visit your GPU manufacturer’s website:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your exact graphics model. Be sure to download the latest correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system. And don’t forget to do a reboot afterwards.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and check if the crash with Spellbreak has disappeared.

If the problem persists, simply continue to the next method.

### Fix 4: Disable in-game overlays

 While in-game overlays make it convenient to share, communicate and purchase, it might also be the culprit of your crashing issue with Spellbreak. If you’re using in-game overlays such as**GeForce Experience** ,**Discord** or**Radeon™ Overlay** , try disabling them and check if it fixes your problem.

 If Spellbreak crashes when you’re not using any overlays, simply try the next solution below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 Some players reported that they managed to fix the crash with Spellbreak by closing the overclocking software. Indeed, overclocking offers a free-of-charge performance boost, but at the cost of system stability. So if you’re using BIOS settings or overclocking software such as**MSI Afterburner** and**Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU)** , there’re great chances that your game will crash constantly. You can therefore try to**stop overclocking** and see if it fixes the crash.

If this method doesn’t work out for you, simply try the next one.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 One possible cause of game crashes is that you’re having**software conflicts** . If that’s the case, you can**perform a clean boot** to root out the offender.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**msconfig** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/msconfig-run-box.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Services** tab, then check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. Find services that**DO NOT** belong to your graphics card or sound card manufacturers such as NVIDIA, AMD, Realtek, Intel.**Uncheck** the boxes next to these services and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and test your gameplay in Spellbreak.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. If the crash stops, you can root out the conflicting software by repeating these steps, but only disable half of the services.

If the crash reappears, you can check out the next solution.

### Fix 7: Disable VSync

**VSync** refers to**Vertical Sync** , a graphics technology that synchronizes the in-game FPS with the refresh rate of your monitor. While it repairs the screen tearing issue in some games, it cloud also trigger instability according to some feedback. So you can try to turn it off and see how it goes.

 You can disable VSync in the control panel of your graphics card. And here’s an example of NVIDIA:

1. Right-click the empty area of your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-control-panel-vsync.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select **Manage 3D settings** . Make sure you’re at the **Global Settings** tab, then click the text next to **Vertical sync** and select **off** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/turn-off-vsync-nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
3. Launch Spellbreak and see if the crash stops.
