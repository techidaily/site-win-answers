## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 methods for you to troubleshoot the Zoom cannot start video error. You don’t have to try them all. Simply work from the top down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Allow Zoom to access your camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Close other programs that use the camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Adjust the Zoom settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your camera driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Allow Zoom to access your camera

 A common cause that your camera isn’t working on an app is related to the permission settings. If you don’t allow the camera access for Zoom, it would stuck at a failed video. To enable the permission properly, follow the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2-3.jpg)
3. Click **Camera** on the left pane. Then, click the **Change** button and turn on the Camera access for this device.

4. **Toggle on** the button under Allow apps to access your camera.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-4-1.jpg)

 Once applying the changes, you can relaunch Zoom and see if the camera is able to work correctly. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

 When other programs are utilizing your camera, Zoom may lose control of your camera and therefore cannot start a video. To make sure there’s no interference with your webcam, try closing unncessary programs especially those telecommunication apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Discord or Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-10.jpg)
2. Right-click the application you want to shut down and click**End task** .

 Restart Zoom and test. If the error reoccurs, continue to the next solution.

1. Launch your Zoom app.
2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-6.jpg)
