### Fix 2: Update video card driver

 A missing or outdated video card driver can cause the**error 132 in WOW** , so you should update your graphics card driver to fix your problem.

 You can manually download the driver from the manufacturer’s website, and install it in your computer to update the graphics card driver. If you don’t have time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_**  ).

### Fix 8: Check for malware and virus

 If your computer is affected by malware or virus, you’re likely to run into the error 132 when playing WOW, or the malware can fake the error message. So you should run a full and complete scan for your system.

 So run a virus scan across your entire Windows system. Yes, it will take some time to complete, but it’s worth it. Unfortunately, Windows Defender may not detect it, so it’s worth trying another antivirus application such as Avira and Panda.

 If any malware has been detected, follow the instructions provided by the antivirus program to fix it.

 Then restart your computer and try to launch your program again to see if it works.

 So that’s it. Hope this post comes in handy and helps resolve the error 132 in World of Warcraft. If you have any questions, feel free to add a comment and we’ll see what more we can do.
