### Fix 3\. Use a VPN

 A VPN can help establish better connections in Escape from Tarkov. Many players find it can really reduce crashes to some extent. Otherwise, they get kicked out all the time.

 You can choose a reliable free VPN or a paid VPN such as[**Nord VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (a[**70% off coupon**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is available now), which comes with 24/7 customer support and a 30-day free trial.

 The difference between a free VPN and a paid one is the ping. Tarkov’s servers are extremely sensitive to any latency or ping fluctuation. So be sure to choose the VPN with the lowest ping.

### Fix 4\. Disable IPv6

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Window** s key +**R** key at the same time.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win + R** at the same time and enter**ncpa.cpl** .

### Fix 7\. Change from DS-Lite to Dual-Stack

 If none of these methods above fix your issue, you can ask your Internet service provider to change from DS Lite to Dual Stack. This has been proved helpful to many players, though it has varying success.

 Dual-Stack allows a device to run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, while DS-Lit (Dual-Stack Lite) is a technology that enables Internet service providers to move to an IPv6 network while simultaneously handling IPv4 address depletion.
