## 1\. Change the power mode

 The default power plan in Windows strikes a balance between power consumption and PC performance, which is a good choice most of the time, especially when you’re not using resource-hungry applications a lot. But games usually need more resources than other regular software programs, so it’s not a bad idea to switch to the **High performance**  plan to see if it helps to drive the FPS and fix the stuttering problems.

To change the power mode:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)
3. Then run Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora to see if the frame rate is higher, and if the stuttering issue is improved. If the problem remains still, please move on to the next fix.

## 2\. Update Windows

This is because a sudden change like this could be caused by faulty or outdated system files or settings, and a Windows update could usually fix the problem.

To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)

3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)
4. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll see**You’re up to date** like this.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png)

 Then try your Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again to see if it still stutters and its FPS still drops. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to the low FPS and stuttering problem in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, so if the above methods don’t help to improve the FPS or the stuttering situation, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png" border="0">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

## 6\. Modify Registry Editor

 There are some gaming-related settings that you can modify in the Registry Editor to see if they help to improve the FPS and the stuttering situation for all games. If you haven’t tried them yet, here’s what you can do:

**WARNING** : Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here: [How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key together. Type **regedit** and hit **Enter** .

## 7\. Close resource-hungry programs

 If there are many bandwidth-intensive services and applications (such as background downloads, music streaming, or video streaming) running when Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is running, please disable them, as their occupation of the network connection resource is likely the culprit to your low FPS and stuttering problems in game.

To do so:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
2. Select each resource-hogging application and click **End Task** to close them one by one.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-49.png)

 Then run Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora again and see if the low FPS and stuttering issues are fixed. If the problem still remains, please move on to the next fix below.
