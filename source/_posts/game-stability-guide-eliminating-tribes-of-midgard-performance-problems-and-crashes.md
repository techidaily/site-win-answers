 6) Restart Steam, and open Final Fantasy XV again and see if it works properly.

 If your game stops crashing, that’s perfect. But if your problem persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Roll back your graphics card driver

 If you’ve updated your graphics card driver right before Final Fantasy keeps crashing, your problem probably lies in your graphics card driver. In this case, you can roll back your graphics driver.

 There are two ways to roll back your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* Manually roll back your driver: you can roll back your graphics card driver by navigating to**Device Manager** \>**Display adapters** \>**Properties** \>**Driver** \>**Roll Back Driver** .

This requires time and computer skills.

* Automatically roll back your driver: if you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the Free or Pro version. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get**30-day money back guarantee** ).

 Open Final Fantasy and see if it stops crashing. Still no luck? Don’t give up hope. There are other solutions.

### Fix 5: Disable NVIDIA Turf Effects

 NVIDIA Turf Effects simulates and renders large grass areas, which provides you with a best possible experience when playing Final Fantasy. However, Turf Effects may cause a memory problem and that could be a reason of your game crashing.

To resolve Final Fantasy crashing, you can disable NVIDIA Turf Effects.

 1) Launch FFXV**Settings** .

 2) Go to**Graphics** \>**NVIDIA TurfEffects** . Then set it to**Off** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3) Save your changes and relaunch FFXV.

 If you can’t open Settings in Final Fantasy XV, you can modify the game settings file in your computer, and change**NvidiaTurf=0** . This will disable NVIDIA Turf Effects for your game.

Hopefully your game will be running up again properly.

### Fix 6: Reinstall your game

 If, unfortunately, the methods above didn’t help resolve your game crashing issue, try uninstalling it from your computer, then reinstall it.

 Usually, this will reset the game settings and clear the game cache, and it may remove what causes your game to crash. Then it resolves your problem as well.
