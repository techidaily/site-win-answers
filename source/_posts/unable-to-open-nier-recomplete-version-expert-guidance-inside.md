### Fix 4: Update your graphics drivers

 One of the most common causes of games not starting is that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . To fully enjoy this remaster, and maybe one of the best AAA titles in 2021, you need to make sure your video driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is update manually: you can go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and search for your model, then download and install the driver step by step. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using**Driver Easy** . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 5: Change program graphics settings

 Some gamers reported that NieR Replicant would cap the frame rate at 60, and higher frame rate might cause the game to stop working. If that’s really the case, you can try to fix it by changing the program settings in your graphics control panel.

Here’s an example for NVIDIA graphics cards:

1. At the empty area of your desktop, right click and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select**manage 3D settings** . In the right pane, navigate to the**Program Settings** and select the**.exe** file of NieR Replicant.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/nier-3d-settings-1.jpg)
3. Under the section of Specify the settings for this program, set**Max Frame Rate** to**60\~65 FPS** .

### Fix 6: Temporarily disable your antivirus

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to enter the Windows settings menu. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
