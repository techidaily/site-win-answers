## Try these fixes

1. [Check the cable](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Rolling back your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Change the screen refresh rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Use windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Check the cable

 Make sure your device has a stable and constantly power supply. The WOW screen flickering issue can be caused by the loose wire between the monitor and the computer. So, plug the cable tightly both at the monitor end and he computer end before trying any fixes.

 If possible, test the cable on another computer and see if the problem also occurs to another computer.

### Method 2: Update graphics card driver

 Because the WOW screen flickering issue is related to the graphic card driver directly, updating your graphic driver is a way to fix the issue. You might update your graphic driver through Windows Update, however, **many drivers are used while gaming and most of them won’t be updated regularly with your Windows Update.**  So, the outdated or corrupted driver could be the culprit for crashing, lagging, or flickering issues.

 You can update drivers one by one through the manufacturer’s official website manually, or update all drivers by **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  with 2 clicks.

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Method 3: Rolling back your driver

 If updating the driver doesn’t work for you, you may need to try this fix, especially when you’re an NVIDIA user. Some users figured out the issue was related to NVIDIA drivers, if the latest driver doesn’t fix the flickering issue, rolling back to an older version of the driver would work. Though it could cause serious loss of optimization for other games and applications.

1. Go to[NVIDIA driver page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Find a older version of the driver and download it.
3. Right-click on the Start button and select**Device Manager** .

4. Click**Display adapters** and right-click on your GPU.

5. Choose**Properties** . Head to the**Driver** tab and click**Roll Back Driver** .

6. Install the driver and reboot your PC.

7. Check the issue is persist or not.

### Method 4: Change the screen refresh rate

 Change the screen refresh rate may fix the WOW screen flickering issue. Some users find lower your refresh rate from 144 to 120 or 100 can fix the issue, others think a low refresh rate is the culprit of the issue. You can change the rate as you like and see if the issue is resolved.

1. Right-click on desktop and select **Display settings** .
