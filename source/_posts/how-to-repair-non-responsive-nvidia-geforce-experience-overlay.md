### _Firefox is already running, but is not responding_

 If you’re now experiencing this problem, then you’ve probably seen an error message like this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-13.png)

 The most straightforward way is to click**Close Firefox** , but sometimes it’ll give no response and Firefox just won’t shut down. In this case, you should:

#### Fix 1: Close Firefox via Task Manager

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to fire up the Run dialog box. Type**taskmgr** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-14.png)

 2) On the**Processes** tab, scroll through the list until you’v found**Firefox** . Select to highlight it, then click**End task** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15.png)

 Exercise caution with this step in case you mistakenly close some important system processes.

3) After the Firefox has been completely closed, relaunch it.

 Wait to see if Firefox continues to present you with the same error message. If it does, try out Fix 2.

---

#### Fix 2: Check your access permission to the profile folder

 1) Launch Firefox and click**Open menu** at the upper right corner.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png)

 2) Click**Help** \>**Troubleshooting Information** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17.png)

 3) On the next page, click**Open Folder** next to the**Porfile Folder** item.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18.png)

 If you cannot open or use Firefox, you’re still able to find your profile folders:  
 1\. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.  
 2\. Type in**%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\** and then click**OK** .  
 3\. When you spot the**li2s42lu.default** file, move down to the steps below to perform further configurations.

 4) Click the**up arrow button** to reach the current directory, namely**li2s42lu.default** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-19.png)

 Right-click**li2s42lu.default** and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-20.png)

 5) On the**General** tab, make sure the**Read-only** option has not been checked. Then, click**Apply > OK** to save any changes you’ve made.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21.png)

Now go on to check if the problem remains with your Firefox browser.

### _Firefox is not responding_

 If you saw few specific details other than “Firefox is not responding” on the error message you received, and the browser didn’t respond to any of your clicks or keystrokes, then here’re some of the most useful methods you should try.

#### Fix 3: Rename the place.sqlite file

 If your Firefox browser keeps hanging from time to time, it’s likely that your_places_ database has been damaged; to fix it, you need to create a new one:

 1) Go to **[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and follow the guidance to open your profile folder.

 2) Double-click to open the**li2s42lu.default** file. Scroll down to locate a file named**places.sqlite** . Also, close your firefox browser if it’s still left open.

 3) Right-click**places.sqlite** and select**Rename** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png)

 4) Rename it as**places.sqlite.old** . (Since its original name is place.sqlite, you just need to add**.old** to the end and then hit**Enter** on your keyboard.)

 Mind that this step will erase your browsing history and delete bookmarks of the day.

 5) Open Firefox and check to see if there’s still any trouble with it.

If this fix didn’t help, please proceed to the next one.

#### Fix 4: Disable hardware acceleration

 You should try disabling hardware acceleration and see if that resolves your problem. Here’s how:

 1) Launch Firefox and click**Open menu** at the upper right corner.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-16.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png)

 2) Click**Options** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) On the**General** tab, in the results pane, under**Performance** , untick the**Use recommended performance settings** check box. Then, uncheck**Use hardware acceleration when available** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30.png)

4) Close Firefox and reopen it.

 If you find that the problem no longer exists, then chances are your graphics card drivers have been corrupt or outdated. You can simply leave hardware acceleration disabled, or update your graphics drivers (in this case you may be able to turn on hardware acceleration again).

 In case you don’t know how to update your graphics drivers, this tutorial may solve your problem:[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[ \[Solved\] | How to Update Graphics Driver in Windows | Easily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### Fix 5: Clear cache & cookies

 It’s wise of you to clear cache and cookies on a regular basis because that will make your Firefox browser run more fluidly and stably. However, clearing cache and cookies will erase your login information (e.g. user name & passwords) for all websites so you’ll need to enter the credentials all over again. On the bright side, though, your privacy can be better protected this way and the Firefox not responding issue may be solved.

 1) Launch Firefox and click**Open menu** at the upper right corner.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-16.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png)

 2) Click**Options** .

 3) On the**Privacy & Security** tab, in the results pane, scroll down until you’ve found the**Cookies and Site Data** section. Then, click**Clear Data…** .

 4) Select the two check boxes as shown below, then click**Clear** . (You can decide whether to clear all these data depending on your actual situation.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 When prompted for confirmation, click**Clear Now** .

 On completion, relaunch Firefox and check whether there’re still times when Firefox becomes unresponsive. In case the problem persists, move on to the next fix, below.

#### Fix 6: Troubleshoot faulty add-ons

 Sometimes the Firefox not responding issue is caused by a faulty extension and the like. You can pinpoint the real culprit by running Firefox in Safe Mode that turns off all the unnecessary add-ons and personal customizations. Here’s how:

 1) Launch Firefox and click**Open menu** at the upper right corner.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-16.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png)

 2) Click**Help** \>**Troubleshooting Information** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-17.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Under**Try Safe Mode** , click**Restart with Add-ons Disabled…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-58.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 When prompted for confirmation, click**Restart** . Then another dialog box will pop up, click**Start in Safe Mode** .

 You can also initiate Safe Mode by pressing the**Shift** key on your keyborad while double-clicking Firefox to launch it.

 4) Use Firefox to browse websites or do other things you want. Just wait to see if it can run properly this time. If it can, then the root cause of your problem should be lying in add-ons, hardware acceleration, or some settings; if it can’t, you should turn to other fixes for help.

 If your Firefox works properly under Safe Mode, you can proceed with the next few steps.

 5)**Disable hardware acceleration** . If you’ve already tried **[Fix 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , simply skip this step; if you haven’t, turn back to **[Fix 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and give it a shot.

 6)**Revert your theme to the default** . To do this, click the**menu** button at the top right and then select**Add-ons** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-59.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-59.png)

 On the**Themes** tab, click on the three-dot button of your disabled**Default** theme and select**Enable** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-61-1024x401.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then, click the menu button at the top right and select**Exit** . After that, reopen Firefox the way you normally do and wait to see if the problem disappears. If it does, then reverting your Firefox theme to the default should have well resolved the issue; if it doesn’t, keep trying the next step.

 7)**Check for problematic extensions** . To do this, click the**menu** button at the top right and then select**Add-ons** (as shown in Step 6).

 On the**Extensions** tab, click on the**three-dot** button of a certain extension and select**Enable** . Then, click the menu button at the top right and select**Exit** . After that, reopen Firefox the way you normally do and see if it works in a proper manner. If it doesn’t, then the extension you’ve enabled just now should be the culprit.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-60-1024x389.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-60-1024x389.png)

 Now, apply the above step to all your extensions one by one until you find out whether any of them was actually causing the problem.

 8) Suppose you find out which extension has caused you trouble, you can try updating it first. To do this, also go to the**Extensions** tab as illustrated in Step 7\. Click the**gear icon** to the right of**Manage Your Extensions** , and select**Check for Updates** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-62.png)

 If there’re any updates detected, click**Install Updates** . Then, click the menu button at the top right and select**Exit** . After that, reopen Firefox the way you normally do and see if it works properly. In case updating extensions didn’t help, you can also check the extension settings, as shown below.

 9) Click the three-dot icon of that extension, and select**Options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-63.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 On the pop-up page, you’ll see quite a few extension settings. Now you should judge by yourself which one might be the cause of your issue and make a change depending on your situation.

Restart Firefox and see if the not-responding problem goes away.

#### Fix 7: Update Firefox to the latest version

 The latest version of Firefox may be able to fix certain technical problems you have encountered (that’s because the developer keeps improving the browser by adding new features or eliminating known bugs). So if you don’t know whether you’re using the latest Firefox version, you should check.

 1) Launch Firefox and click**Open menu** at the upper right corner.

 2) Click**Help** \>**About Firefox** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-36.png)

 3) Then Firefox will check automatically whether your version is up-to-date and update it if it isn’t.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-37.png)

 In this screenshot, Firefox has been updated to the latest version.

 After the automatic download process is complete, click**Restart to update Firefox** . Now your Firefox browser should be up-to-date. Wait to see if you’re still confronting moments of unresponsiveness; if the issue reoccurs, then you should try refreshing the Firefox browser.

---
