## Try these fixes

 There’re 2 types of lag relevant to gaming – one is FPS lag, the other is network lag. If you’re experience the FPS lag, usually you can adjust your graphics settings to fix it. If you’re experiencing network lag instead – your network connection has slowed down, you can check for bandwidth-hungry apps and your network settings.

 Here’re some know fixes for the Dota 2 lagging issue. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

 One of the most common causes of lags during gameplay is the faulty or incompatible graphics driver.

 To roll back your graphics driver to the previous version, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

#### Update your graphics driver

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-357.png)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-358.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
