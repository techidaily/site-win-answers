## Fix 1: Verify the game files

 One of the common causes of A Total War Saga: Troy crashing issue is the corrupted game files. If it’s the case, you need to verify the game files. Here’s how to do it:

1. Launch Epic Games launcher and go to your**Library** . Click**the cog icon** on the lower-right corner of**A Total War Saga: Troy** .
2. Click**Verify** to start verifying the game files.  
![Verify the game files in Epic Games launcher](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-50-45.png)
3. Launch the game after the verifying process completed to see if it would crash again. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 The broken or outdated graphics driver may also be the main culprit behind the game crashing issues.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel keeps updating their graphics drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

1. Go to[the Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtime Web Install page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .
2. Click the Download button to start the download.  
![download latest DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-latest-DirectX.jpg)
3. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded**.exe** file to install it on your computer.
4. Restart your computer and launch the game.

 See if A Total War Saga: Troy crashes again. If this fix didn’t work for you, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking
