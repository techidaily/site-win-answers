| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel i5-4440 |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                          |
| **Graphics**  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                        |
| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space             |

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
