Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **Sound Card:** | DirectXÂ®-compatible                   |

 Run DayZ again after you disabled Steam Overlay to see if you can play the game without crashes. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you donâ€™t know how to do it.
