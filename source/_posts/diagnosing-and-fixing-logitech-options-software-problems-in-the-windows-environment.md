 This problem could be also due to an old or corrupted driver, particularly your video card driver. You could solve it through updating your device driver.

 Or if you are not confident working with drivers manually or you don’t have enough time, we recommend you do it automatically with  **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
