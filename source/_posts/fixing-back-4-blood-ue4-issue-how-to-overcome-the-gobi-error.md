### Fix 1: Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re dealing with game crashes, first you need to check if you have**the latest intact game files** . You’re likely to run into issues with missing or corrupted game data.

Here’s how to verify file integrity on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Right click**Back 4 Blood** and select**Properties..** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/b4b-verify-4.jpg)

 The[latest B4B hotfix](https://www.back4blood.com/en-us/news/october-11-2021-hotfix) is available now. During the verification process, your game files will be updated as well.

Once done, restart your game and see if it crashes again.

 If Steam can’t find any faulty game files, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes are usually driver-related, meaning that you might be using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . If you want to fully enjoy the latest AAA titles like Back 4 Blood, first make sure if your drivers are also up to date.

 NVIDIA has given Back 4 Blood a performance boost in the latest driver update. See below for update instructions.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding your GPU and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and check if Back 4 Blood crashes again.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t give you luck, you can try the next method.

### Fix 3: Check for conflicting programs

 Some software, especially**hardware tuning utilities** such as MSI Afterburner and Razer Synapse 3, could undermine the stability of your system and thus crash 3D programs. To avoid these interferences, you can do a clean boot and see how it goes.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .

2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .

6. Restart your PC.

 Now you can start Back 4 Blood and see if it crashes again. If it doesn’t, you can locate the trouble makers by repeating these steps and disabling half of the programs and services.

If the issue lingers on, you can continue to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Make sure Windows is up to date

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’re sure Windows is up to date, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Back 4 Blood.

 If your system is already the latest, simply move on to the next solution.

### Fix 5: Move game files to your Steam drive

 According to some players,**moving game files to the same drive of Steam** might be a cure to the fix. So if you have your games installed in another drive, try moving them to your Steam drive and check the result. This trick was originally used to fix the disconnection issue.

 You can right-click your Steam client to get the location. To find out where Back 4 Blood is installed, right-click Back 4 Blood in your Steam Library to open properties and browse local files.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/b4b-browse-2.jpg)

 Some players also reported that having the**Epic Games** client opened might get the game working. You can try the same and see how things go.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, you can try the next one below.
