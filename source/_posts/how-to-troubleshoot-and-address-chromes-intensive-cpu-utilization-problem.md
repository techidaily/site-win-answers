### Fix 1: Restart the modem and router

 Many factors can cause Madden 22 stuck on the loading screen. One of them could be connection-related. To troubleshoot your network connection, the first thing you can do is to restart your modem and router. By doing this, the cache will be cleared up and your IP address will be renewed. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Unplug** the modem and router from the power outlet.

2. **Wait** for one minute.
3. **Reconnect** the modem and router to the power outlet. Make sure the indicators are back to their normal state.

 Once youâ€™re back online, restart Madden 22 to see if you can get past the loading screen.

### Fix 4: Update your network driver

 Being stuck on the loading screen could indicate that you have a poor connection, which can be caused by a broken or outdated network driver. To fix this issue, you need to make sure youâ€™re using the latest network driver.

 One way to do that is to visit the motherboard manufacturerâ€™s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support?mktsrc=drivereasy%5Fen%5F153179) ,[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/?mktsrc=drivereasy%5Fen%5F153179) ) and search for your model, then download and install the network driver manually. But if you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/de-scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you donâ€™t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/de-wifi6.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easyâ€™s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 After updating your network driver, restart your computer and try relaunching Madden 22 to see if it does load without issue now.

If the issue remains, try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Change your DNS settings

 If updating your network driver doesnâ€™t solve your connection problem, you can try setting an alternate DNS, like Google DNS. This will improve the resolution speed and provide you with more security online. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open Windows Settings. Then click**Network & Internet** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/network-Internet.jpg)
2. Under Advanced network settings, click**Change adapter options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/change-adapter-options.jpg)

Try relaunching Madden 22 and see if it does load without issue now.

If this fix doesnâ€™t work for you, proceed to the next one.

### Fix 6: Delete game data on Xbox

 For Xbox players, if youâ€™re stuck on the loading screen when launching madden 22, you can try to fix this issue by deleting saved game data. Since this cannot be undone, it is highly recommended that you back up your saved game data to online storage before deleting it. Hereâ€™s how:

1. On Xbox Home, select **My games & apps** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/my-games-apps.jpg)
2. Highlight Madden NFL 22, press the **Menu** button on your controller, then select **Manage game & add-ons** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/manage-game-add-ones.jpg)
3. Select the **Saved data**  box, then choose the item you want to delete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/xbox-saved-data.jpg)

Try launching Madden 22 again to check if it can load normally.

If not, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type**msconfig** and click**OK** .

6. Restart your computer.

 Once you restart your computer, try launching Madden 22 again and check if the game is still stuck on the loading screen. If not, you can try to enable services one by one until you find the problematic software. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic program that conflicts with Madden 22, you just need to uninstall it to avoid the issue in the future.

 If the game still wonâ€™t load after you disabled all the programs and services, try the last fix below.

### Fix 8: Use a VPN

 If Madden 22 is still stuck on the loading screen after you try all the fixes above, maybe give VPN a shot. By using a VPN, you can get a better Internet connection during rush hours, which may help you to solve the problem of Madden 22 not loading. Here are some VPNs we recommended:

* **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Surfshark](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[CyberGhost](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Avoid using free VPNs, since they rarely resolve your issues but could bring many problems.
