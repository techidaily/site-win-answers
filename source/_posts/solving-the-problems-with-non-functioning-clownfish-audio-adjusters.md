### Method 5: Set exception on your antivirus software

 Antivirus software aims to protect your computer safety, but they can block part of the game feature and cause problems. It is possible that the Dragon Age: Inquisition won’t launch issue is caused by your antivirus software. If some important features were blocked by your antivirus software, the game may not function properly and cause issue.  
 To solve this, you can add the game into your antivirus software’s exception list. If you don’t know how to do this, you can contact its customer service.
