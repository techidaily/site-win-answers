### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Some applications can interfere with your Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, especially your antivirus software. To check if this is the cause of ‘Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous not launching’, you can temporarily uninstall your antivirus software because simply disabling it might not work.

 If this doesn’t work, there might be other applications that are conflicting with your game. You might want to **[perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to find the problematic one and uninstall it temporarily.

![nvidia control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/control-panel.jpg)

 2) Select**Manage 3D Settings** under**3D Settings** .

 3) Click on the Program Settings tab and select**Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous** from the drop-down list.
