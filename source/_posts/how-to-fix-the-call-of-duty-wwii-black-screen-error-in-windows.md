## 3\. Update the graphics driver

 If this error code 80070057 persists after you tried “Scan and Repair” and “Check for Updates”, it is mainly related to the video file, which can be caused by an outdated/corrupt driver or driver incompatibility.

 A missing or outdated graphics driver can cause the**Error Code 80070057** in COD: Black Ops Cold War, so you should update your graphics card driver (and sometimes your sound card driver, too) to get rid of this error message.

 You can manually update the graphics driver by downloading the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website such as[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and install it manually. If you don’t have time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version), and then install it manually on your computer.
