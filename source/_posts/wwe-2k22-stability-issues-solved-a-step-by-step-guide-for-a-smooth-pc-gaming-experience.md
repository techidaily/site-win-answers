### Fix 2: Update the graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game issues (such as game crashes, freezes, and lags), is a missing or outdated graphics driver.

**4)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If the_Dota 2_ crashing issue persists, then move on and try the next method.

### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 The_Dota 2_ crashing issue is sometimes triggered by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If the game works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 4: Run the game as an administrator

_Dota 2_ may not be able to access certain game files on your computer under normal user mode, which could lead to the game crash. To fix it, try running the game as an administrator:

**1)**  If Steam is running now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-342.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-342.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

**3)** Click **Yes** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Verify the integrity of game files

_Dota 2_ is likely to crash when one or more game files are damaged. So you should verify the game files to make sure any corrupt files fixed and missing files installed. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-321.png)

**3)**  Right-click **Dota 2**  and select **Properties.**

### Fix 6: Adjust virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

_Dota 2_  is likely to crash if the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files. Follow the instructions below to adjust the size of your virtual memory and see if this is causing your problem:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger. In most cases, setting your virtual memory as 4096M is enough.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-909.png)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .
