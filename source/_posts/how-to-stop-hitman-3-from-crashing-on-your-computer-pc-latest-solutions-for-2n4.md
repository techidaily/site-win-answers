1. Go to your Steam**Library** .

### Fix 3: Run the game as administrator

1. **Right-click** the executable file of Gas Station Simulator and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Compatibility** tab, then check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** to save changes.

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/run-program-as-administrator.jpg)

 Once you have done this, restart Steam and try launching the game again to see if your problem has been resolved.

If the crashing issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re more likely to encounter the crashing issue in Gas Station Simulator. To fix the potential problem and get the best performance, you should always **ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card installed** .

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/scan-18.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your computer and launch Gas Station Simulator to see if the game crashes again.

 If updating your graphics driver doesn’t work for you, proceed to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Check your antivirus settings

 Some antivirus programs could block your game from running and cause the game to crash. To see if that’s the case for you, you can temporarily disable your antivirus.

 If Gas Station Simulator stops crashing after you disable the antivirus, you’ll need to whitelist Steam and the game. This process will vary depending on the antivirus software you’re using.

 But if the game remains crashing after disabling your antivirus, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 The programs running in the background could interfere with your game. To fix it, you can perform a clean boot to figure out if the crash was caused due to a software conflict. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/msconfig.jpg)
2. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab and check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as**Realtek** ,**AMD** ,**NVIDIA** and**Intel** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hide2.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the**Startup** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-disable-programs.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

 Relaunch Gas Station Simulator to check if the game crashes again. If not, you can try to enable services one by one until you find the problematic software. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic program that causes the game to crash, you just need to uninstall it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.
