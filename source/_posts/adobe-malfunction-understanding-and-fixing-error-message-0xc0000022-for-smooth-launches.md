 If this method doesn’t solve your crashing issue, you can continue to the next one.

### Fix 2: Install all the Windows updates

 Windows 10 includes 2 types of updates, one is**quality updates** , which provides security and reliability fixes, another one is**feature updates** , which add new functionalities twice per year. If you can’t remember the last time you installed any updates, definitely do it now as it could be a potential fix to your problem.

You can install system updates with just a few clicks:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate** and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-update-run-box.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . This might take a while for Windows to search and install the updates.

3. Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer for it to take full effect.

 To make sure you’ve installed_all_ the system updates,**repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click Check for updates.

 Once you’ve updated your system, launch Marvel’s Avengers and see if it crashes again.

 If this fix doesn’t work for your case, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, crashing issues tend to be driver-related, which means you’re probably using a**faulty** or**outdated graphics driver** . So updating your driver could very well tackle your problem right away.

 GPU manufacturers update their drivers frequently so as to quickly adapt to the fast-changing game market. The updates usually include bug fixes and stability improvements, which can to some extend prevent the game from crashing.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To manually update your graphics driver, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website and search for your model:

* [**NVIDIA**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then you’ll see many download options. Choose the latest installer that is compatible with your system version. Don’t forget to restart your computer after updating.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with_full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated the graphics driver and restarted your computer, open Marvel’s Avengers and see if the crash persists.

 If this method doesn’t give you any luck, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Disable all the overlays

**Using overlay for games** is another possible cause for crashing. So if you’re using overlays like**Steam** ,**Discord** or**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** , you can try to disable this feature and start the game directly.

 For example, if you’re using**Steam** , you can disable the overlay with these steps:

1. On the top left corner of your Steam client, click**Steam** and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steam-settings.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**In-Game** tab,**uncheck** these boxes and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disabel-steam-overlay.jpg)
3. Launch Marvel’s Avengers and see if it crashes again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If this fix doesn’t do the trick for you, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 5: Close all the background programs

 Some AAA titles require all the resources of your rig, and sometimes they crash because you have other programs eating up your RAM or CPU resources. So check if you’re running large programs such as**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Skype** . If you do, close them before launching Marvel’s Avengers.

### Fix 6: Turn off VSync

 VSync is “**Vertical Sync** ” for short. It’s a feature that locks your FPS at a certain range, which is believed to be a solution to screen tearing. But VSync has downsides too. It might cause system instability and crash your game. Usually GPU manufacturers will release driver updates targeting this issue, but before that update comes out, you can try to fix the crash by simply disabling VSync.

 You can turn off VSync in your**graphics control panel** . For example, if you’re using a NVIDIA graphics card:

1. Right-click a blank area on desktop, then select NVIDIA Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nvidia-control-panel-vsync.jpg)
2. Of the menu on the left, select**Manage 3D settings** . Make sure you’re at the**Global Settings** tab, then click the text to the right of**Vertical sync** and select**off** .
