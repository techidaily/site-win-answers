### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 Your game FPS drops because of the wrong or outdated driver. To see if that’s your case, you should update the device drivers, especially the graphics card driver.

 There are two ways to update the driver: manually and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your device, find the latest version for the driver, then download and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

Then install it in your computer.Or click**Update Al** l to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

### Fix 5: Check for software conflicts

 Sometimes the software conflicts can cause FPS drops in CS:GO, especially when you’ve installed any software, or turn on any features in your computer. So check it out.

Below shows you examples of the programs that usually cause conflicts:

* Antivirus programs, such as Windows Defender.
* Overlay programs, such as GeForce Experience
* Programs that you just installed
* Windows built-in features, like Firewall

 Try closing or uninstalling these programs, and see if it fixes your problem. If so, contact the developer of the software for advice.

 Note: If you close antivirus program, or Windows firewall, be extra careful about the website, emails, and links you open. And remember to re-open it later on.
