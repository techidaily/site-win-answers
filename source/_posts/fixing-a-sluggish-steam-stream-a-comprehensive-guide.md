### PRO TIP: Update your device drivers

 An old, missing or corrupted driver might not cause this problem to occur, but it’ll cause problems to your video games, especially a wrong video driver. So we highly recommend **keeping your drivers up-to-date for the best gaming experience** .

 You can download the latest video driver from your video card’s manufacturer’s website, like AMD, NVIDIA.

Or

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all drivers problems of your computer.
