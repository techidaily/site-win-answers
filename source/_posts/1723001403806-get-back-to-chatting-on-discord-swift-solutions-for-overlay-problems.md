## Fix 6: Enable experimental features

 Enabling experimental features in GeForce Experience allows you to access updates and features that haven’t been released to all users. Try this solution to see if the GeForce overlay not working issue persists. Here’s how:

1. Open GeForce Experience, then click the gear icon to open**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/geforce-setting.jpg)
2. In the left panel, select**GENERAL** . Under the ABOUT section, tick the box next to “**Enable experimental features** . A GeForce Experience update may be required.”.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/enable-experimental-feature.jpg)

Once done, check if your GeForce overlay is working.

If not, move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 7: Disable third-party services

 Sometimes the third-party services may prevent GeForce overlay from working properly. Try temporarily disabling them to see if your GeForce overlay works or not. If GeForce overlay starts working again, try to enable third-party services one at a time to figure out the problematic services. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** to open System Configuration.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/msconfig.jpg)
3. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab, check the box of**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
4. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT NVIDIA services, then click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/uncheck-services.jpg)
5. Restart your computer.

 After the computer completely reboots, check if your GeForce overlay is working. If it starts working now, you’ll need to re-enable services one by one in System Configuration until you find the problematic one. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

If this method doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next fix.
