### Fix 2: Check the version of the platform apps

 Clownfish Voice Changer is used on Skype, Discord and other apps. So when youâ€™re using the latest Clownfish but it doesnâ€™t work, it could be the platform application problem.

 Check youâ€™ve updated the platform app to the latest version and restart the program again.

### Fix 3: Installing your microphone in clownfish

 To solve the Clownfish Voice Changer not working problem, the microphone should not be ignored. Because the application needs to use your microphone to detect your voice and translating it to the system.

1. Run Clownfish.
2. Right-click on the**Clownfish** icon in the Taskbar.  
 Note: Click the**^** button if Clownfish was hidden in the Taskbar.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
