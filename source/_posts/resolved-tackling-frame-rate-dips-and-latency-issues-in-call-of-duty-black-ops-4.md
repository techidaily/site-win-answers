 New games often come out with some bugs, and Deathloop is no exception. One of the issues plaguing many gamers is that**the game keeps freezing on their PC and PS5** . Although we are not sure what is causing the problem currently, there are still some workarounds you can try.

 Avoid using the Windows \[**ALT** \]+\[**TAB** \] function as it can have an impact on the framerate.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

### Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the minimum requirements

 If you’re experiencing random freezes when playing Deathloop, you should first check to ensure that your PC meets the game’s minimum requirements.

| OS        | 64 bit Windows 10 version 1909 or higher         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Processor | Intel Core i5-8400 @ 2.80GHz or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 |
| Graphics  | Nvidia GTX 1060 (6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 580 (8GB) |
| Memory    | 12 GB RAM                                        |

 Once you’ve confirmed that your device is good enough to run Deathloop, you can continue with the following fixes.

### Fix 2: Use your primary graphics card

 If your game does not perform as well as you expect with your AMD or Nvidia graphics card, it may be running with the wrong GPU. To fix it, you can switch the game to your primary graphics card. Here’s how:

1. Launch Deathloop and navigate to**Options** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/deathloop-options.jpg)
2. Select**Visuals** , and then under**Video Settings** , ensure the**Video Card Selection** is set to your primary graphics card.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/deathloop-video-card.jpg)

Check if you still have the freezing issue in Deathloop.

If this does not resolve the problem, proceed to Fix 3\.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver is essential to a smooth gaming experience. If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, you’re more likely to encounter the freezing issue in Deathloop. To fix it, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card installed.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-nvidia-gtx-1080.jpg)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and launch Deathloop to check if your problem is resolved.

If the game still keeps freezing, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 4: Close background programs

 Too many programs running in the background will take up more sources and slow down your PC. You can free up your system resources by closing all the additional programs in the background. Here’s how:

1. Right-click your**taskbar** and select**Task Manager** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png" border="0">WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab,**right-click** the processes that are CPU and memory-hogging, and select**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/end-task.jpg)
3. Relaunch Deathloop and test the gameplay.

 If the freezing issue still occurs after closing all the background programs, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Switch to Performance Mode on PS5

 Some players reported that Deathloop has a smoother performance with Performance Mode selected on their PS5\. To set Performance Mode on your PS5, follow these steps:

1. Go to the PS5 Home Screen and select the**Settings** icon (a small cog) on the top right side.
2. Choose**Save Data and Game/App Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ps5-saved-data.jpg)
3. Select**Game Presets** , then make sure**Performance Mode** is selected.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496" border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ps5-performance-mode.jpg)

 Now you can enjoy your game with higher frame rates. Check if the freezing issue persists.

If this method doesn’t do the trick, check out the last fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Power cycle your PS5

 If you’re experiencing the issue of Deathloop keeps freezing on your PlayStation 5, you can try to power cycle your console. Here’s how:

1. Press and hold the**power button** on your controller.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ps5-power-button.jpg)
2. Turn off the PS5 with**Turn Off PS5** and not “Enter Rest Mode”.
3. Make sure the light goes out on the console and then**unplug its power cable** and**wait for 10 seconds** .
4. Plug the power cable back in and turn the console back on by pressing the**power button** on your controller.

Check if the game freezes again.

 If none of the methods above solve your Deathloop freezing problem, the problem could be caused by the game itself. Then there is nothing you can do except waiting for a specific patch to release.
