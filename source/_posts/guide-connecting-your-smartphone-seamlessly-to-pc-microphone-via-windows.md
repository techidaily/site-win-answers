### Key Takeaways

* Windows does not offer a native feature to use a smartphone as a microphone, but you can use a third-party app like "WO Mic" to do the job.
* Using the WO Mic app, the simplest way to turn your phone into a microphone for your PC is by connecting via Wi-Fi. This method works on both Android and iOS.
* If Wi-Fi isn't available, you can connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct, but be aware that these choices are only available on the WO Mic Android app, not on iOS.

 Don't have a high-quality microphone? Want to use your Android phone as an audio input device for your computer? While Windows doesn't offer a native feature for this, you can use a third-party app, WO Mic. Here's how to transform your Android phone into a mic for your PC.

##  Download WO Mic on Your Phone and Computer

 To begin, download the WO Mic app on your phone and computer. Go to the [official WO Mic website](https://wolicheng.com/womic/download.html) on your PC, download the setup file for Windows, and complete the installation. The app automatically handles the download of necessary drivers, eliminating the need for manual installation.

 If you haven't installed the VC runtime redistributable before, you may need to download and install it now. So, go to the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170), and download the compatible version.

![Downloading the VC Runtime Redist. package from Microsoft Website.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downloading-the-vc-runtime-redist-package-from-microsoft-website.png) 

 Make sure to complete this step before proceeding. Otherwise, you will encounter DLL errors.

 After that, open the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001608/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wo.voice2) on your Android phone, find the WO Mic app, and install it. Find and download the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wo-mic/id1260978417) if you're using an iPhone.

 Once the app is installed on your phone and computer, you can use your phone as a microphone through the app using four different methods: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB tethering, and Wi-Fi Direct. All four methods work on an Android device, but on iOS, only the Wi-Fi option is supported.

##  Use Your Phone as a Microphone Via Wi-Fi (Android and iOS)

 This method requires that your phone and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, so ensure they are. Then, open the WO Mic app on your phone and find the IP address.

 To get the IP address on your Android device, you need to manually select the connection type, Wi-Fi, from the app settings. To do this, tap on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner and select "Settings."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Within the Settings menu, tap "Transport" and select "Wi-Fi" from the available choices.

 Return to the app's homepage, tap on the play button in the top-right corner, and you should now see an IP address displayed on the app's homepage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 WO Mic automatically detects that you are connecting via Wi-Fi on your iPhone. Tap on "Start" at the bottom, and you should see an IP address displayed at the top.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Once you have found your phone's IP address, open the WO Mic app on your PC, navigate to the "Connection" tab, and select "Connect."

![Opening the connection settings in the WO Mic desktop app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-opening-the-connection-settings-in-the-wo-mic-desktop-app.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Select "Wi-Fi" from the available Transport Type options and enter your phone's IP address into the field labeled "Phone IP Address," then click "Connect."

 This will establish the connection, converting your phone into a microphone for your computer. You can now use it for all voice input going forward.

###  How to Terminate the WO Mic Connection

 To terminate the connection on Android, tap the stop icon located in the same place where you began the connection by tapping the play button. On your iPhone, tap on "Stop" in the bottom-left corner.

 Alternatively, you can end the connection directly from the desktop app. Navigate to the "Connection" tab and click on "Disconnect."

##  Use Your Phone as a Microphone Via Bluetooth (Android)

 If Wi-Fi is unavailable, you can use Bluetooth to turn your Android phone into a microphone for your computer. Start by [turning on the Bluetooth on your Windows 11 device](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-creative-filmmaking-on-a-budget-using-smartphones-as-webcams-for-2024/) (or [Windows 10](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maximizing-marketing-the-best-highlight-techniques-for-brands/)) and [Android phone](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-oppo-find-x6-by-drfone-android/) to make them visible to other devices. Then, establish a Bluetooth connection between your Android device and your Windows laptop.

 Open Settings on your Android device and go to Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth. Locate and tap on your Windows device name. The path may differ depending on the Android device you have.

 Then, a notification will appear on both your Android phone and the Windows laptop. Tap on it, select "Pair" on your Android phone, and "Yes" on your Windows computer. This will establish a Bluetooth connection between your phone and computer.

 That's it! Record any audio on your PC using your Android phone's microphone!

##  Use Your Phone as a Microphone Via Wi-Fi Direct (Android)

 To use your Android phone as a microphone via Wi-Fi Direct, you first need to [configure and activate the Wi-Fi hotspot](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/a-filmmakers-approach-to-classroom-instructional-videos-for-2024/) and connect your laptop to it.

 After that, click on the Wi-Fi icon in the system tray on your laptop and expand the Wi-Fi menu. Here, locate the hotspot connection, click "Connect," enter the hotspot password, and click "Next."

![Conecting a Windows device to a smartphone hotspot.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/conecting-a-windows-device-to-a-smartphone-hotspot.jpg) 

 Once your laptop is connected to your smartphone's hotspot, launch the WO Mic app on your Android phone. Tap on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, open "Settings," tap on "Transport," and select "Wi-Fi Direct" from the available options.

![Selecting the Wi-Fi Direct option from the transport options in the WO Mic Android app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-5-selecting-the-wi-fi-direct-option-from-the-transport-options-in-the-wo-mic-android-app.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then, on your desktop, open the WO Mic app, navigate to Connection > Connect, select "Wi-Fi Direct" from the left side, and click "Connect."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 This process will establish the connection, allowing you to use your Android smartphone for audio input!

##  Windows Not Detecting Your Phone's Microphone?

 If Windows fails to recognize your phone as your computer's primary audio input device, you might need to manually set it as the default option in your sound settings.

 Search for "Change System Sounds" in Windows Search and open the sound settings. Then, navigate to the "Recording" tab. If the WO Mic Device is not set as default, right-click on it and select "Set as Default Device."

![Selecting the device's built-in microphone as default in the sound settings on Windows.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-selecting-the-device-s-built-in-microphone-as-default-in-the-sound-settings-on-windows.jpg)
