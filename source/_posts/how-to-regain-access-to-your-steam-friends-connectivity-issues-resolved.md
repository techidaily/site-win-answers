## Is Xbox Live Down?

 Here are 3 methods for you to determine if itâ€™s an Xbox Live down problem. Just work your way down until you find it out.

1. [**Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Check Xbox Server Status**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Look up the error messages or codes**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Check if your other devices are able to connect to the same network

 When you have a connection issue on Xbox Live, it is important to check **whether your Xbox One console or PC (if youâ€™re using Xbox app on your computer) is the only device with no Internet connection** .

 To do so, simply check other devices (your phone, tablet, TV set) to see if theyâ€™re online properly.

* **If these devices cannot connect to the Internet either** , then obviously the problem does not lie with your Xbox or PC. You can either do some basic troubleshooting on your modem by yourself (such as performing a reboot on your modem) or contact your ISP for assistance to fix the issues with your network.
* **If these devices can access the Internet properl** y, then you should move on to**Method 2** , below to narrow down the problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 2: Check Xbox Server Status

 With home network issues ruled out, you might want to check if itâ€™s a service server outage or not. To do so, simple go to the official[**Xbox Live Status**](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) . From there, youâ€™ll see the status information of Xbox services, games, websites and apps.

* **A green check icon** indicates that the server is working properly. If you still have trouble connecting to Xbox One, you might have to jump to Method 3 to locate the culprit.
* **A red exclamation mark** means the server is currently down. You can also read the on-screen information to know more about the outage and the affected platforms. Often, there is a**Notify me** option you can choose to get instantly notified by an email when the service is back online again.

**So, is Xbox Live UP or DOWN?** Share it in the comments section below or report your issues to let others know that theyâ€™re not facing it alone! ðŸ™‚

### Method 3: Look up the error messages or codes

 Now that youâ€™ve confirmed neither your home network or the server is to blame, the error is probably on your end. You can start by checking your Xbox screen for error to see if there is any error message or code on the screen. If you see an error code or message, head to[**Xbox One Error & Status Code Search**](https://support.xbox.com/en-HK/error-code-lookup) and enter the exact same message or code as shown. Then follow the on-screen troubleshooting steps to work on the issue.

## Bonus tip: Xbox Live still not working on my PC?

 If youâ€™ve exhausted all the fixes lain out on Xbox Support, but the Xbox One not working issue is still not resolved, then itâ€™s time to check if itâ€™s a driver issue on your computer. As a wrong or outdated network driver may cause slow Internet connection, Internet keeps cutting out or even app not connecting to Internet problems. So you should**update your network drivers** to see if it fixes your problem.

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and**you get full support** and**a 30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b5af0deb80ba.jpg)

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.

 4) Restart your computer and see if Xbox Live works properly on your computer.
