Check if the GeForce overlay not functioning issue still occurs.

If the issue persists, go ahead with the next fix below.

1. Open GeForce Experience, then click the gear icon to open**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/geforce-setting.jpg)

## Fix 7: Disable third-party services

 Sometimes the third-party services may prevent GeForce overlay from working properly. Try temporarily disabling them to see if your GeForce overlay works or not. If GeForce overlay starts working again, try to enable third-party services one at a time to figure out the problematic services. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** to open System Configuration.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/msconfig.jpg)
3. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab, check the box of**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
4. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT NVIDIA services, then click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/uncheck-services.jpg)
5. Restart your computer.

 After the computer completely reboots, check if your GeForce overlay is working. If it starts working now, you’ll need to re-enable services one by one in System Configuration until you find the problematic one. Then restart your computer to apply the changes.

If this method doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 8: Repair Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

 The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages basically make sure some programs work and function properly without experiencing conflicts. If these redistributables are corrupt, it may lead to your GeForce overlay not working. You can follow the steps below to fix this issue:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/appwiz.cpl_-1.jpg)
3. In Programs and Features, right-click**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** and select**Change** . (You need to repeat the same process for all the listed Visual C++ Redistributable packages, but you can skip 2008 and older versions.)
