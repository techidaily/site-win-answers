## Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum requirements for Destiny 2

 The Destiny 2 broccoli error may point to a system that does that meet the minimum requirements for the game. So before attempting anything more advanced, you should compare your system to the officially suggested specifications to see if your PC is powerful enough to run the game.

Here’s how:

| **MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS** | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS**                                                   |                                                                             |

| **GPU**                    | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB or AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB             | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB or AMD R9 390 8GB                |
| **RAM**                    | 6 GB                                                                             | 8 GB                                                                        |

2. Click**Open settings** .
3. In the left of the window, click the**Video** tab, then for the**Frame rate** item, select**On** ; for**Frame rate cap** , set the value to**72** .

## Fix 4: Switch game mode

However, not all PCs are made the same – some players have noticed an invisible improvement in FPS and smoothness with the mode on, while for others the opposite is the case.

 Regardless of whether you’ve tweaked the feature before, you can switch the mode on and off to see if it helps you get rid of the broccoli error in Destiny 2.

## Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many players would overclock their CPU or GPU to crank out extra performance out of the existing system. The downside is that, high clock speed may induce stability issues and even crashes to your system.

 If your game starts to crash after you’ve overclocked your CPU or GPU, try reverting it to the default setting. After that, fire up Destiny 2 to see if the crashing issues have ceased.
