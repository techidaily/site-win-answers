![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration.png)
3. Select the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration2.png)
4. On the **Startup** tab in **Task Manager** , for **each** startup item, select the item and then click **Disable** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration3.png)
5. Go back to the **System Configuration** window and click **OK** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration4.png)
