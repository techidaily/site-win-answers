Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |

| **Memory:**     | 8 GB RAM                              |
| **Graphics:**   | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

#### The recommended system requirements for DayZ

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-Settings2.png)

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
