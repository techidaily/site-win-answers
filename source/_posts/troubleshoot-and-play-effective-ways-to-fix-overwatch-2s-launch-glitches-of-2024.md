## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

* [Path of Exile Minimum requirement](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

1. [Start a new instance](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Reinstall RoE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Change a server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

* [Bonus tip: Update your driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Start a new instance

 This is the first and the easiest way to fix the issue which works for some gamers.

1. Launch the game.
2. Press the**Ctrl** key on your keyboard while**clicking** on the Zone entrance.
3. Click**NEW** to start a new instance.

If it brings no luck, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Reinstall RoE

 Uninstalling and Installing Path Of Exile is a working fix for some gamers. It may be because a clean uninstallation deletes all caches and corrupted files, so the reinstallation works.

1. Type**control panel** on your search bar and open it.
2. Set Control Panel view by**Category** and click Uninstall a program.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Locate Path Of Exile and right-click on it. Click**Uninstall** .
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and finish the whole process.
5. Download and install the latest Path Of Exile version.
6. Relaunch the game and check if the issue persists or not.

If this fix doesn’t work, head to the next one.

### Fix 3: Change a server

 It’s better to know whether the server you’re going to connect is overcrowding or not. You can ping towards the game server before connecting to the game. If it’s a crowding server, you’d better change to another one.

 This tip would reduce the chances of encountering connection issues on PoE.

This is a short list of game servers you can ping to.

| Australia      | au.login.pathofexile.com  |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Texas          | us.login.pathofexile.com  |
| Washington D.C | wdc.login.pathofexile.com |
| California     | sjc.login.pathofexile.com |
| Amsterdam      | eu.login.pathofexile.com  |
| Frankfurt      | fra.login.pathofexile.com |
| London         | lon.login.pathofexile.com |
| Milan          | mil.login.pathofexile.com |
| Brazil         | br.login.pathofexile.com  |
| Paris          | par.login.pathofexile.com |
| Moscow         | mo.login.pathofexile.com  |

If you don’t know how to ping, here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** together on your keyboard.
2. Type**cmd** and press the**Enter** key.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Select any of the locations that you’re willing to connect to and type the address in Command Prompt, then press the Enter key.  
 Here’s an example.

Then you’ll know whether this server is a good choice.

### Fix 4: Use a VPN

 If the case is related to the unstable connection to servers, instead of changing a server, a VPN service would help. It’s a working fix that has been proved by many gamers even they say it’s ridiculous.

 Well, VPN is a great tool not only to solve the “failed to connect to instance” issue in Path Of Exile but also to protect your privacy and secure your connection. If you have a VPN service, give it a try.

 If you don’t have a VPN service, you can try it for free. Many famous VPN brands provide money-back guarantees, you can cancel the service and get your money back if it’s not working or you don’t like it.

Here is the list of VPNs with money-back guarantees.

 That’s all the working fix for Path Of Exile “failed to connect to instance” issue.

 Sadly, most of the time, the cause of the Path of Exile Failed to connect to instance error lies entirely on developer Grinding Gear Games’ side, there’s little we can do except waiting for a fix.

### Bonus tip: Update your driver

 Maybe try adjusting and updating your graphics (even though you shouldn’t have to) to take off some of the strain of the loading screen.

 With outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter game crashing, lagging, freezing, and other issues. Updating drivers in time not only solve issues but also improve your gaming experience.

 Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version, there’re two ways you can do to update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-path-of-exile-failed-to-connect-to-instance/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download drivers from the manufacturer’s official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**
