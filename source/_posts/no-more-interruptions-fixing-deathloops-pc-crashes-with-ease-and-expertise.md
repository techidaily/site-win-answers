### Fix 1: Meet the minimum requirements

 Make sure your PC has meet the game’s minimum requirements, otherwise the game can’t run properly on your PC.

| OS        | 64 bit Windows 10 version 1909 or higher         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Processor | Intel Core i5-8400 @ 2.80GHz or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 |
| Graphics  | Nvidia GTX 1060 (6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 580 (8GB) |
| Memory    | 12 GB RAM                                        |
| Storage   | 30 GB available space                            |

### Fix 2: Run as administrator

 Set the game file Run as administrator sounds cliche, but it works sometimes. Let Deathloop have higher authority may prevent the program from not launching issue.

1. Navigate to the game’s installation folder.
2. Right-click the **Deathloop.exe file** and select **Properties** .

4. Relaunch the game and check if it’s running properly.

If this fix doesn’t work, move to the next one.

### Fix 3: Close third party software

 If you have third party software running on the background while playing Deathloop, they might be the reason for the Deathloop not launching issue, especially when you have MSI Afterburner and RivaTuner Statistics Server on your computer.

1. Press the Ctrl + Shift + Esc together to open **Task Manager** .
2. Under the Process tab, right-click a program you’d like to close and click **End task** .

3. Launch Deathloop again to check.

 In fact, the main culprit of the issue is RivaTuner Statistics Server. If you want to keep MSI Afterburner functioning, you need to set Application Detection Level to Medium and under it, because the High level would causes the game to hang and crash.

### Fix 4: Update your drivers

 If you don’t have other software running on the background, you may take a look at your drivers. The outdated or wrong drivers may cause the Deathloop not launching issue. Correct and up-to-date drivers would prevent potential errors and improve your hardware performance.

 Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 5: Set the frame rate

 Set your graphic card frame to 60\. Some gamers found when they uncap and run anything above 60, they got massive stutter and frame dumping with RTX 3070\. By the way, if you’re using Raytracing, you’d better turn if off as it was causing Deathloop not launching issue, frame drops and stuttering.
