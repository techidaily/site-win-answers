### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your games or multimedia programs.

 Whether you choose to update your graphics driver manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 2: Verify the integrity of your game files

 Game crashing issues are likely to occur when one or more game files are damaged or missing. To see if that’s the issue for you, try verifying the integrity of your game files from Steam. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY.**

If your game still crashes, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 3: Check for software conflicts

 If your game keeps closing unexpectedly, it’s possible that one of the software you run is conflicting with your game or game launcher. Try turning off unnecessary applications on your PC to see if any of them are causing your issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)**  Right-click**your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-25_10-53-50.jpg)

**2)**  Right-click the program you want to close and select **End task** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.
