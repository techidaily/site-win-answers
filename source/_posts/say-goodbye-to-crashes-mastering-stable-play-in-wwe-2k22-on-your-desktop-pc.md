| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **OS**        | Windows 10                        | Windows 10                            |
| **Processor** | Intel Core i3-3250 AMD FX-4350    | Intel Core i5-9600k AMD Ryzen 5 2600  |
| **Video**     | Nvidia GTX 660 AMD Radeon HD 7850 | Nvidia GTX 1060 AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT |

### Fix 2 – Stop overclocking

 By overclocking your CPU and GPU, you may see a significant boost in the game performance. However, doing this can sometimes lead to problems like instability in the system and crashes your game. So if Diablo 2 Resurrected keeps crashing after an overclock, you may want to**turn off all the overclocking utilities** such as MSI Afterburner and**reset your processor to the default** .

If this method doesn’t help, check out your graphics driver.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver is essential to a smooth gaming experience. If your graphics driver is faulty or outdated, Diablo 2 Resurrected crashing is more likely to occur. To fix it, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

 You can search for the newest graphics driver that corresponds with your operating system from the GPU manufacturer’s website such as[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , and then download and install it manually.

1. Go to the game’s installation folder.
2. Right-click the Diablo 2 Resurrected executable (.exe) file and select**Properties** .
