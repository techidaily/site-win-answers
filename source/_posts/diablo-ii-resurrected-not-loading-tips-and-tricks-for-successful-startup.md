### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The Diablo II: Resurrected not launching issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix any compatibility issues with the new games and get the best performance, you should make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

There are two ways for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t solve the problem, you can take a look at the next method.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 Windows often release new updates to bring new functionality, improve your system security, and tackle the compatibility issues with some new programs. To ensure Diablo II: Resurrected works properly on your PC, you’ll need to download and install the latest Windows updates. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Windows Settings. Then select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/updates-security.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Check your antivirus settings

 Antivirus and malware checkers may prevent your game from launching, even if the application is legitimate and safe. To rule out this possibility, you can temporarily disable your antivirus.

 If the launching issue is resolved after you disable the antivirus, you’ll need to whitelist the Battle.net launcher and Diablo II: Resurrected. This process will vary depending on the antivirus software you’re using.

But if the game still fails to launch, check out the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 Sometimes the programs running in the background can interfere with your game, such as those with overlays. You can perform a clean boot to figure out if the Diablo II: Resurrected not launching issue was caused due to a software conflict. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/msconfig.jpg)
2. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab and check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
3. Uncheck all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as**Realtek** ,**AMD** ,**NVIDIA** and**Intel** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hide2.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the**Startup** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. Right-click on each item and select**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/task-manager-disable-programs.jpg)
6. Restart your computer.

 Try hitting the Play button again and check if you can launch Diablo II: Resurrected now.

 If this resolves the issue, enable the startup application one at a time to determine which one is causing the problem. You will need to restart your computer between each application you enable.
