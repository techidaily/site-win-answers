## Fixing the Risk of Rain T Crashes - Solutions That Work for Gamers

Encountering crashing issues while playing Risk of Rain 2 can be frustrating. These crashes may result from a variety of factors, such as outdated graphics drivers, software conflicts, corrupted game files, low RAM, or incompatible game settings.

 It can be challenging, if not possible, to identify the core issue of the game crash since you all have your own game settings and use unique hardware, but no worries. This article provides 6 solutions to help you rule out common causes of this error and potentially resolve this problem.

## Fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Run Steam as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Disable your antivirus temporarily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Run the game in compatibility mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reinstall Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Game issues, including crashes, freezing, or lag, are often caused by outdated or corrupted graphics drivers. Keeping your graphics driver up to date is a critical step. There are two ways you can get the correct graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the**Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**4)** Restart your computer and the game to test your issue.

 If this didn’t resolve your issue, then go ahead with the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Run Steam as an administrator

 Risk of Rain 2 might not have full access to your PC’s game files or folders in normal user mode. To check if this is the cause of the crashing issue, try running Steam with administrator privileges.

**2)** Right-click the**Steam icon** and select**Run as administrator** .

### Fix 3: Disable your antivirus temporarily

 Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with game performance. Temporarily disabling your antivirus can help determine if it’s causing the problem. You can consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.

 If disabling your antivirus resolves the issue, consider contacting the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 Occasionally, game files can become corrupted or altered due to malware on your PC. If your game is crashing for no obvious reason, consider verifying the integrity of your game files through Steam.
