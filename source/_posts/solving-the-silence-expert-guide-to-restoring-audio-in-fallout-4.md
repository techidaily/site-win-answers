3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If thatâ€™s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases. Thereâ€™s no need for you to download the patch manually, as it would be detected and automatically installed by Steam. You can wait around and see if the issue is fixed.
