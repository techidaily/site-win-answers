 A missing or outdated driver may also trigger the game crashing issue. If it’s the case, this issue can be easily resolved after you update your drivers.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest drivers for your computer.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact PC model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**
