## Achieve Smooth Gameplay in Outriders by Solving Persistent Lag Issues Today

The Outriders has released its demo in February but players keep complaining about its horrible net coding. You’re not the only one experiencing lag in-game, and here’re some methods to help you improve the situation.

## Try these methods

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that helps.

1. [**Meet the requirements**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Use a wire connection**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Meet the requirements

 Outriders is a brand new shooter IP from People Can Fly, which has requirements for computer hardware. Therefore, make sure your PC meets the minimum requirements.

| **CPU**              | Intel I5-3470 / AMD FX-8350                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Graphics**         | Nvidia GeForce GTX 750ti / AMD Radeon R9 270x |
| **Storage**          | 70 GB available space                         |

### Method 2: Use a wire connection

 It’s recommended to use an ethernet connection instead of WIFI. Although WIFI is convenient to use, it’s less stable than a wire connection, especially for online gaming.

**Tip** : Stop downloading other files while hosting with your friends to play Outriders.

 If you’re already using an ethernet connection, please to move to the next fix.

### Method 3: Update your drivers

 The game has had graphic driver issues in the past that would show performance worsen. On the other hand, network driver would affect your internet connection. Therefore we recommend to update your graphic driver and network adapter driver.

 You can manually update these drivers by going to the manufacturer’s official websites, but there’s an easier way — use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your drivers.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter/ graphic card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 That’s it, hope it helps. The issue mostly relates to the game servers so there’s not much we can do. Hope the lagging issue would be fixed at launch.
