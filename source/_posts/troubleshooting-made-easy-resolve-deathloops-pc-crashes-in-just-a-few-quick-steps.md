## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 Streum On Studio (the developers of Necromunda: Hired Gun) releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam or Epic Games Launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Necromunda: Hired Gun to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Disable overlays

 Sometimes overlays may interfere with the game. According to some PC gamers, it seems that the Steam Overlay doesn’t pair well with the game.

 You can try disabling Steam Overlay for Launch Necromunda: Hired Gun and see if the game crashes again. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Necromunda: Hired Gun_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 Launch_Necromunda: Hired Gun_ and see if the game crashes. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Add the game as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 Some third-party antivirus software hooks very deep into your system, and it may interfere with the game. If some important game files are blocked by the third-party antivirus software, the game will crash.

 You can try adding both the game and steam (or Epic Games Launcher) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, you can also try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before you play the game.

 See if the game crashes after you add it as an exception to your antivirus software. If it persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Stop overclocking / turbo boosting

 Many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.
