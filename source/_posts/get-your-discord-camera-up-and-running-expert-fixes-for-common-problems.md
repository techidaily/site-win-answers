<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3:**Close all** background**applications**

 Detroit: Become Human is a demanding game, and the crash can occur when you have some other large programs eating up your CPU resources and RAM. So if you’re running big programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Windows Update** , be sure to close them before launching your game.

If this fix failed to solve your issue, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, the crash of new games tends to be graphics-related. It usually indicates that you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Whether you’re using a 1,000 dollars gaming rig or just a five-year-old school laptop, always make sure you make the most out of it, with the latest graphics driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Remember to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. And always restart your PC after updating device drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
