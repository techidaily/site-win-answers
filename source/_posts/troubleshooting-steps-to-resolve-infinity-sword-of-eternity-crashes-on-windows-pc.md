## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Add the game as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 Some third-party antivirus software hooks very deep into your system, and it may interfere with the game. If some important game files are blocked by the third-party antivirus software, the game will crash.

 You can try adding both the game and steam (or Epic Games Launcher) as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, you can also try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before you play the game.

 See if the game crashes after you add it as an exception to your antivirus software. If it persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Stop overclocking / turbo boosting

 Many players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.
