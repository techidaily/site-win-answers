* [For PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [For smart TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [For phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fixes for Amazon prime video not working on PC

* [Reboot the browser](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Check your internet connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Disable your VPN and third-party apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Reboot the browser

 Make sure your Amazon Prime video account is paid and active. You can go to[your account page](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?%5Fencoding=UTF8&accountStatusPolicy=P1&clientContext=135-4224850-9503066&openid.assoc%5Fhandle=usflex&openid.claimed%5Fid=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier%5Fselect&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier%5Fselect&openid.mode=checkid%5Fsetup&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&openid.pape.max%5Fauth%5Fage=0&openid.return%5Fto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fsettings%2Fref%3Ddv%5Fweb%5Fauth%5Fno%5Fre%5Fsig%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbisafetynet2-20) to check.  
 Make sure you’re using the latest version of your browser.

 Then close the web browser and restart it. Or you can change another browser to open Amazon prime video.

### Fix 2: Check your internet connection

 If you encounter buffering or frequent pauses, loading, check your internet connection. Stop other internet activities and shut down unneeded programs.

#### Update your internet driver

 Updating your internet driver to the latest and correct version is important for your network.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-amazon-prime-video-not-working-2020/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer’s official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 3: Disable your VPN and third-party apps

 VPN is a great tool to protect your privacy but Amazon Prime Video doesn’t always come along well with VPNs.

 If you’re a VPN user, disable it and check whether it fixes the issue.

 If you don’t have VPN, disable third-party apps such as your antivirus software and ad-blocker software. Some of them may overreact and cause conflicts with the Amazon Prime Video or give an internet connection error.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful in using the Internet after uninstalling/disabling your antivirus software.

 Make sure your Amazon Prime video account is paid and active. You can go to[your account page](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?%5Fencoding=UTF8&accountStatusPolicy=P1&clientContext=135-4224850-9503066&openid.assoc%5Fhandle=usflex&openid.claimed%5Fid=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier%5Fselect&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier%5Fselect&openid.mode=checkid%5Fsetup&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&openid.pape.max%5Fauth%5Fage=0&openid.return%5Fto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fsettings%2Fref%3Ddv%5Fweb%5Fauth%5Fno%5Fre%5Fsig%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dbisafetynet2-20) to check. Check your app version, update it to the latest version.  
 Then close the Prime video app and restart it, if it doesn’t work, reboot your smart TV. Rebooting is always the first and effective method to try.

### Fix 2: Resign-in to the app

 Sign out and sign back into the app sounds stupid, but it works for many people. You can select Settings on your TV and sign out.

Close the app, reopen, then enter your credentials to sign back in.

### Fix 3: Make sure you have the right HDMI cable

 Check your HDMI cable, sometimes it’s the cable cause the issue. If you’re watching Prime Video on a device that connects to your display via an HDMI cable, you need to check whether the cable is causing the issue.

If the cable is the culprit, you may need to purchase a new cable.
