### Fix 1 – Run the game as an administrator

 Your game may not launch when it can’t access the necessary permission. So, to make sure it works without interruption, you should run Monster Hunter Rise as an administrator.

1. Go to the game’s installation folder, which is usually located at**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common** .
2. Locate the**MonsterHunterRise.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .

 Directly launch the exe file to see how it works. If it still doesn’t start properly, try**running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8** . This is a simple workaround for many players.

Still no luck? Move on to the next method below.

### Fix 2 – Allow your game through Controlled Folder Access and antivirus

 It’s also possible that Windows Security and other antivirus have prevented Monter Hunter Rise from running, and therefore the game fails to launch. To tweak the settings, follow the steps below:

1. On the Windows search box, type**windows security** and select**Windows Security** from the results.

2. Select **Virus & threat protection**  from the left pane. Scroll to the Ransomware protection section and click **Manage ransomware protection** .

 If you have also installed any third-party anti-virus software like McAfee, Bitdefender and Avast, make sure your game is added to their whitelists and not blocked.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of game bugs or not launching is**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . A driver update can tackle compatibility issues of new games like Monster Hunter Rise and offer a zero-cost performance boost. So before you try anything more complicated, check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 You can update the GPU driver manually by visiting the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and downloading the latest driver corresponding with your system. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amd-6800xt.jpg)

 Once done, restart the computer for the changes to take effect. Then test if the issue reoccurs. If yes, there are a few more fixes below.

### Fix 4 – Disable resource-hogging programs

 If too many resource-hogging applications are running in the background, that may interfere with your game and make it crash or not open. It’s better to close these applications while playing Monster Hunter Rise. Here’s how:

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-1.jpg)
2. Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what apps are consuming your resources most. Then right-click the process you want to end and select **End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ta-3.jpg)

Check if the game launches as expected. If not, take a look at Fix 5.

### Fix 5 – Verify the integrity of game files

 To troubleshoot any missing or damaged game files that might cause MHR to malfunction, you could perform an integrity check. Newly-released games keep rolling out patches, and doing this will also check for the game updates.

1. Open Steam and go to**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. From the game list, right-click**Monster Hunter Rise** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1.jpg)
3. Select**Local Files** from the left pane and click**Verify intergrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

 It may take a few minutes to finish scanning and repairing. Then you can restart the game to see if the problem persists. If so, continue to the last method.
