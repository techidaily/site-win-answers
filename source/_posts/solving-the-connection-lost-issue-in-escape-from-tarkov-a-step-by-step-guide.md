### Fix 1\. Pick a server with the best ping before playing

 Many gamers find it helps when they choose the best server. You should uncheck automatic server selection and choose the server with the lowest ping.

 Does the ‘Server Connection Lost’ error in Tarkov persist? If the manual server selection doesn’t do the trick, you can try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2\. Restart your router

 It may simply be caused by your internet connection, especially when others are not having this issue.

1) Unplug both your modem and router,

2) Leave them for at least 30 seconds.

3) Plug your modem, then your router back into the power source.

4) Test the server issues in Escape of Tarkov.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3\. Use a VPN

 A VPN can help establish better connections in Escape from Tarkov. Many players find it can really reduce crashes to some extent. Otherwise, they get kicked out all the time.

 You can choose a reliable free VPN or a paid VPN such as[**Nord VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (a[**70% off coupon**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is available now), which comes with 24/7 customer support and a 30-day free trial.

 The difference between a free VPN and a paid one is the ping. Tarkov’s servers are extremely sensitive to any latency or ping fluctuation. So be sure to choose the VPN with the lowest ping.

### Fix 4\. Disable IPv6

 Many players fix this issue by disabling IPv6\. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but still, it’s worth a shot. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Window** s key +**R** key at the same time.

 2) Enter**ncpa.cpl** in the Run box.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ncpa-1.jpg)

 3) Right-click your active network adapter (**Ethernet** or **Wi-Fi** ) and select **Properties** .

 5) Click**OK** to save the changes.

You may need to restart your computer for the setting to take effect.

### Fix 5\. Update your network drivers

 If the network adapter driver you’re using is faulty or outdated, you will possibly encounter this ‘Server Connection Lost’ error in Escape from Tarkov. To fix the potential problems and enjoy ensure less lagging, you should install the latest network driver on your computer.

**Manually –** To update your network adapter driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 6\. Switch to a static IP

 Instead of letting your router assign whatever IP address is free at any given time, you can assign specific IP addresses to the devices you access frequently. And this turns out to be a temporary fix for ‘**Server Connection Lost** ‘ for a few Escape from Tarkov players. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win + R** at the same time and enter**ncpa.cpl** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ncpa.jpg)

 2) Right-click your active connection, and select**Status** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/status.jpg)

 3) Click**Details** .

 4) Note down the**IPv4 Address** and**IPv4 Subnet Mask** . You can write it down or take a screenshot because you will need this later on.

### Fix 7\. Change from DS-Lite to Dual-Stack

 If none of these methods above fix your issue, you can ask your Internet service provider to change from DS Lite to Dual Stack. This has been proved helpful to many players, though it has varying success.

 Dual-Stack allows a device to run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, while DS-Lit (Dual-Stack Lite) is a technology that enables Internet service providers to move to an IPv6 network while simultaneously handling IPv4 address depletion.
