### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check to see if the cutscene lag issue is solved. If it doesn’t do the trick, please continue with**Fix 3** , below.

 Fix 3: Adjust your graphics settings

 According to some players, tweaking the in-game settings of Resident Evil Village has helped them resolve the lag issue in Resident Evil Village. You could try it too and see how it goes:

* Screen resolution: Native
* Image Sharpening: Off
* Vertical sync: Off
* Power Management : Prefer Maximum Performance
* Low Latency Mode : Off
* Rendering mode: Normal
* FidelityFX CAS: Off
* Ray tracing: Off

### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If that’s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases. There’s no need for you to download the patch manually, as it would be detected and automatically installed by Steam. You can wait around and see if the issue is fixed.
