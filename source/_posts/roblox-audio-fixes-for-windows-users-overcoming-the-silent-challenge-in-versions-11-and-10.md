 A refresh restart will reset the software and desktop environment and can often fix software glitches like this.

 So if you haven’t done this yet, give it a shot. A simple restart may be all you need to solve Roblox or Roblox Studio-related issues.

### Fix 2 – Try an alternative browser

 Roblox is compatible with all leading browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and more. To make sure Roblox works well on your device, make sure you’re using the latest version of the browser.

 If you’re still unable to get into a Roblox game from your current browser, try a different one to see if it works. For example, if you can’t launch your Roblox game from Chrome, try opening Firefox and launch the game.

 If Roblox won’t load the game from any browser, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 3 – Reset your Internet Options

 In some cases, you can fix Roblox loading issues by resetting your PC’s Internet Options.

 You’ll need to open Internet Explorer to perform the following steps, but this will fix problems even if you use other browsers, such as Chrome, to play the game.

**1)**  Run **Internet Explorer** .

**2)** Click the **gear button** on the top-right corner of your screen, then click **Internet options** .

**6)** Try launching your game.

If Roblox still gets stuck when loading the game, try the fix below.

### Fix 4 – Disable your ad-blocker/extensions

 Browser extensions, especially ad-blockers that modify page content could also interfere with Roblox. So if you’re running any browser extensions, you may also want to try disabling them.

 This process varies slightly in different browsers. If you’re using Chrome, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Open Chrome.

**2)** Click the **Menu** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**4)**  Click the **toggle**  to disable your extensions one by one, try relaunching your Roblox game each time to check if your problem is caused by any of these extensions.

 If your game still won’t load correctly, don’t fret. Try the next fix.

### Fix 5 – Check your Firewall

 As with all multiplayer games, Roblox requires an internet connection to send and receive data.

 If Roblox is having issues loading games, there’s a good chance your Firewall is restricting Roblox’s access to the internet. Follow the instructions below to see how to check if Roblox is allowed through your Windows Defender’s firewall:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time.

### Fix 6 – Temporarily close your anti-virus

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and firewall and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 9 – Update your device driver

 A missing or outdated device driver can bring various problems to your computer, so updating your device drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your computer.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update or use a trusted third-party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
