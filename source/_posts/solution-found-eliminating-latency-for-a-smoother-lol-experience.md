### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics driver, also called a video card driver, is essential to the functioning of video games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re likely to encounter the crashing issue in Psychonauts 2\. To fix the potential problem and get the best performance out of your hardware, you should make sure your computer’s graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
