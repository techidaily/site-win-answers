## Troubleshooting Made Easy: Resolve Deathloop's PC Crashes in Just a Few Quick Steps

![deathloop crashing](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/deathloop.jpg)

 Deathloop is one of the most anticipated games of 2021 for its intricate and stylish elements. However, since the game was released, there have been increasing complaints about technical glitches. One of the most reported is Deathloop crashing. If you happen to have the same problem, don’t worry. Here are 6 simple fixes to get your game back to working.

 If you want to gain a smooth gaming experience with Deathloop, make sure your PC meets the[minimum system requirements](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/) .

## Fixes to try

 You may not try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that solves your problem.

1. [**Run Deathloop as an administrator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Use the dedicated GPU**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Temporarily disable third-party software**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Verify the integrity of game files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Turn off overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Run Deathloop as an administrator

 By default, Windows runs a program as a regular user, but this may prevent it from accessing necessary permissions. To make sure Deathloop works properly, you should run it as an administrator.

1. Navigate to the game’s installation folder.
2. Right-click the**Deathloop.exe file** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/run-as-administrator-1.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Then tick**Run this program as an administrator** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/run-the-game-as-an-administrator.jpg)

 Restart the game to test. If the crashes reoccur, continue to the second fix.

### Fix 2 – Use the dedicated GPU

 An integrated GPU may find it hard to support graphics-intensive games. If Deathloop crashes with an_Intel GPU not supported error_ , it means you need to use a stronger GPU. If you have two GPU installed on the computer, follow the steps to choose the dedicated GPU to run the game.

1. In the Windows search box, type**graphics setting** s and click**Graphics settings** .

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The Deathloop crashing issue will occur if you are using a wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So you should update the graphics driver to see if that fixes your problem.

 You can search for the newest graphics driver from the GPU manufacturer’s website such as[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) , and then install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/amd-6800xt.jpg)

 Reboot your computer after the driver update completes, and check if Deathloop still crashes. If so, try the next solution.

### Fix 4 – Temporarily disable third-party software

 If you’re running multiple software when playing Deathloop, the software conflicts may cause the game to crash. As many players reported, disabling certain third-party software such as**MSI Afterburner and Rivatuner Statistics Server** helped mitigate the Deathloop crashing.

You can also close all unnecessary apps in the background. Here is how:

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/right-click-task-bar-task-manager.jpg)
2. Under the Process tab, right-click a program you’d like to close and click **End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/disable-unnecessary-programs-running-in-the-background.jpg)

<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Now that you should only leave Deathloop and your game launcher running. Test if you’re able to play the game as expected. If not, check out two more fixes below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted games file is one of the most known reasons for game crashes. If Deathloop keeps crashing, you can do an integrity check to see if there is anything wrong with the game files.

1. Launch Steam and go to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click Deathloop and click**Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/verify-game-files-3.jpg)
3. Click**Local Files** on the left and click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/verify-game-files-2-1.jpg)

 It will take several minutes for the detecting and repairing to complete. Once done, relaunch Deathloop to check whether the issue gets fixed. If not, move on to the last solution below.

### Fix 6 – Turn off overlay

 While in-game overlay allows you to access certain features during your gameplay, it might interfere with Deathloop and prevent it from working correctly. So when you’re having trouble running a game, it’s a good idea to turn overlay off on apps like[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

1. Run your Steam client.
2. Click**Steam** at the top right and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-1.jpg)
3. Select**In-Game** from the left. Then untick**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** , and click **OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/disable-steam-overlay-2.jpg)

#### On Discord

1. Launch Discord.
2. Click the **cogwheel icon** at the bottom of the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-2-1-1.jpg)
3. Select the **Overlay** tab in the left pane and toggle off **Enable in-game overlay** .
