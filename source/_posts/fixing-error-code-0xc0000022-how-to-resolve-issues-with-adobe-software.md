## Fix 1: Stop overclocking your GPU

 You might overclock your GPU in order to boost your game’s FPS. But it’ll lead to an increase in heat, and thus reduce the lifespan of your hardware components. So if you’ve been overclocking it, try to disable it.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics drivers

 You might not be able to launch your games if your graphics drivers are corrupt or out-of-date. So to have a better gaming experience, have them updated.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your graphics drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics drivers

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps releasing updates for the drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official website, find the drivers that are compatible with your PC, and install them on your own.

 Here are the most common graphics drivers. Simply click the link based on your needs.

[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29804/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-15-40-?product=80939)

<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics drivers (recommended)

 If you don’t feel like updating the drivers all on your own, we recommend you use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs the correct versions of drivers that your computer needs. With Driver Easy, updating graphics drivers becomes much easier.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any outdated or missing drivers.

![update drivers; scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-1.png)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to _your graphics driver_ to automatically download the correct driver for your computer, then you can manually install it.

OR

 Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  with **full support**  and a 30-day **money-back guarantee** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![update graphics drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/update-all-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After that, launch your game to see if the problem is solved. If not, try to update other drivers including sound drivers, and DirectX drivers as well.

 If you’ve had all your drivers updated and the problem persists, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Verify the integrity of game files

 1) Run Steam. Under the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on**Team Fortress 2** and select**Properties** .

![Team Fortress 2 verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-1-1.png)

 2) Select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

![Team Fortress 2 verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

## Fix 5: Set Launch Options

 This method is proven to be working for many game players. So you can give it a shot by following these steps:

 1) Run Steam. Under the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on**Team Fortress 2** and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-1.png)

 2) Under the**GENERAL** tab, click**SET LAUNCH OPTIONS** .

![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-2.png)

 3) When the window pops up, type**autoconfig** and click**OK** .

![set launch options Team Fortress 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-launch-options-3.png)

 Till then, try running the game. If you want to go back to the previous launch options, just delete**autoconfig** following the steps listed above.

 If this didn’t do the trick, it might be a problem related to fullscreen. Then you can type**windowed -noborder -w \[SCR-H\] -h \[SCR-W\]** in[step 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**\[SCR-H\]** and**\[SCR-W\]** are the height and width of your screen.  
 If your screen resolution is 1920 \* 1080, then the line you should type in is**windowed -noborder -w 1920 -h 1080** .  
  
 You can check your screen resolution by following these steps: 1) Right-click on the empty space on your desktop and select**Display Settings** .  
 2) In the**Display** section, scroll down to**Display resolution** .
