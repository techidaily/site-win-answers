![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Steam-Settings2.png)

 Run DayZ again after you disabled Steam Overlay to see if you can play the game without crashes. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
