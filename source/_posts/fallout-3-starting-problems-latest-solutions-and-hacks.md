## Fix 1\. Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is the heart and soul for games like Valorant. If the game constantly crashes on your PC, it is likely that the graphics driver on your computer is outdated or corrupt. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the crashing issue.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by going to the manufacturer’s website ([**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) | **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), finding the latest driver package and installing it step by step. If you don’t have the time or patience to download and install manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
