### Fix 1: Check the game’s system requirements

 Before you begin to troubleshoot the low FPS issue in Fallout 76, make sure your device meets Fallout 76’s system requirements. If it doesn’t, you may need to upgrade your hardware to improve performance. The system requirements for Fallout 76 on PC are as follows:

#### **Minimum:**

| Operating system: | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processor:        | Intel Core i5-6600k 3.5 GHz/AMD Ryzen 3 1300X 3.5 GHz or equivalent |
| Graphics:         | NVIDIA GTX 780 3GB/AMD Radeon R9 285 2GB or equivalent              |
| Memory:           | 8 GB RAM                                                            |

#### **Recommended:**

### Fix 2: Disable background applications

 The applications running in the backgrounds can eat up your system resources, causing your device to have no sufficient RAM for your game. To free up more system resources and improve your game performance, you can disable all the unnecessary background applications before gaming. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up**Task Manager** .
2. Once at a time,**right-click** the CPU and RAM heavy program (like Chrome and Discord) and select**End task** to close it.

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

Once done, launch Fallout 76 to see if your FPS has improved.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of low FPS is that you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. The graphics card manufacturers regularly release new drivers to optimize for new games. To get the best performance of your hardware, you should keep your graphics driver updated.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and launch Fallout 76 to check the game performance.

If this method doesn’t work for you, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 4: Adjust the in-game graphics settings

 Lowering the game’s graphics settings can also help you boost FPS. To do so:

1. Launch Fallout 76 and click**SETTINGS** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fallout76-settings.jpg)
2. Select**DISPLAY** , then set the Window mode to**Fullscreen** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fallout76-fullscreen.jpg)
3. Lower the**Quality** settings on**Texture** ,**Water** ,**Lighting** and**Shadow** .
4. Lower the**Fade** settings on**Actor** /**Item** /**Object** /**Grass** .

Restart the game to test the game performance.

 If you’re still experiencing low FPS in Fallout 76, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Turn off VSync

 VSync, or vertical sync, is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game with a gaming monitor’s refresh rate. Many players have confirmed that turning off VSync helps improve their FPS in Fallout 76\. You can give it a shot. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open**File Explorer** . Then type**Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76** in the address bar.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/file-explorer-fallout-76.jpg)
2. Open the**Fallout76Prefs.ini** file.

3. Use the shortcut key**Ctrl+F** to search the word ‘**iPresentInterval** ‘. Then change “iPresentInterval=1” to “**iPresentInterval=0** “. This will turn off VSync.

Launch Fallout 76 again to see if your FPS has improved.

If this fix doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.

### Fix 6: Change your power plan

 Your computer’s performance could be limited by the power plan you selected. To make the most out of your PC, you can change your power plan to High performance. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke The Run dialog box. Then type**powercfg.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/powercfg.cpl_.jpg)
2. Under Preferred plans, select**High performance** . (If you don’t see it, expand Hide additional plans.)

Relaunch Fallout 76 to test the game performance.

If your FPS is still very low, try the next fix.

### Fix 7: Optimize NVIDIA settings

 To get the best performance for your game, you can optimize the graphics settings through NVIDIA Control Panel. Here’s how:

1. On your desktop, right-click any empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)
2. Select**3D settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** from the left panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nvidia-manage-3d-settings.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Program Settings** and select the**Fallout 76.exe** file from the drop-down list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/program-settings-fallout76.jpg)
4. Modify the settings as below:  
 Maximum pre-rendered frames:**1**  
 Preferred refresh rate:**Highest available**  
 Power Management Mode:**Prefer maximum performance**  
 Threaded optimization:**ON**  
 Vertical sync:**OFF**

Once done, restart Fallout 76 and your FPS should increase dramatically.

 For AMD users, you can go to AMD Radeon Software to configure similar options.
