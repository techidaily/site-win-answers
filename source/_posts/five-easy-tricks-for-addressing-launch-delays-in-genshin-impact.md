### Fix 1: Update Epic Games Launcher

 Actually, many Borderlands 3 gamers find the fix as simple as updating the Epic Games Launcher. If updates need to be installed, the launcher should automatically detect them.

 However, sometimes it just fails to install the update. The**Restart and Update** button under**Settings** is gone now, but you can restart Epic Games a few times to see if this magically works.

### Fix 2: Verify integrity of game files

 It’s always wise and easy to check your game files first. Corrupted game files can stop Borderlands 3 from launching successfully. To see if that’s your problem, you need to verify the game files.

 1) In**Epic Game Launcher** , navigate to your**Library** . Click the**cog icon** on the lower-right corner of**Borderlands 3** .

![open library](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1027.png)

 2) Click**Verify** and wait till the verification to complete.

![verify game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1026.png)

 After verifying the game files, relaunch Borderlands 3 to see if it’s fixed. If so, then congrats! If not, don’t worry, there are a few fixes you can try.

---

### Fix 3: Run as administrator

 Borderlands 3 sometimes may not be able to access certain game files on your PC under normal user mode, which could be the cause of the not launching issue. To fix it, you can try running it as an administrator.

 1) Right-click the**Epic Games Launcher** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .

![open epic launcher](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1020.png)

 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab and check the**Run this program as an administrator** box. Then click**Apply** and**OK** .

![go to the compatibility tab](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-997.png)

 3) Go to the directory where you installed Borderlands 3, and run the .exe file as administrator as well.

 4) Relaunch**Borderlands 3** from the Epic Games Launcher to test the issue.

If the problem still persists, then go ahead with the fix below.

---

### Fix 4: Check for Windows updates

 To ensure compatibility, you can always check if you have the latest updates. If your PC is running on Windows 10, you just need to perform a Windows Update.

 1) Type**updates** in the search box, then select**Check for updates** .

![check for updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/check-for-updates.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) If there are updates available, you can click**Download** , then follow the on-screen directions to finish installing.

![update Windows](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-970.png)

 Or if it says**You’re up to date** , just click**Check for updates** . Windows will start searching for available updates and automatically download and install the updates if there are any.

 Once you’ve updated your system, perform a complete shutdown and restart your PC, then see if the issue is fixed.

---

### Fix 5: Update device drivers

 Sometimes Borderlands 3 may fail to launch because of a**corrupted or outdated driver** ,**especially your graphics card driver** (sometimes your sound card driver). In that case, you’ll probably experience the Borderlands 3 not launching or crashing issues.

 Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can make your game run smoother and prevents other possible issues or errors.

 You may either download the most up-to-date drivers online and install them manually, or simply**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-974.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Reverting back to DX11

 If you try to enable DX12 on Borderlands 3 and get stuck in loading forever, you can try to set it back to DX11 and it will work again.

 1) On your PC, go to  
 **%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\My Games\\Borderlands 3\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor\\**

 2) In WindowsNoEditor, right-click the file titled**GameUserSettings** .**ini** and select**Edit with Notepad** .

 3) In Notepad, scroll all the way down to find the line where it says**PreferredGraphicsAPI** and change**DX12** to**DX11** , then save the file.

![DX12 to DX11](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1010.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4) Restart your PC and relaunch Borderlands 3 to test the issue.

 The support for DX12 API is still in beta stages for the game, so the issue will likely be fixed soon with an update, but it’s up to Gearbox Software to deliver the update in a timely manner. On the bright side, players who opted to play the game in DX11 mode are all set because it works perfectly fine in DX11 mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 Borderlands 3 not launching is sometimes caused by your third-party antivirus application. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and check if the problem persists.

 Since Borderlands 3 consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when it’s running, many third-party antivirus applications may regard it as a potential threat and Borderlands 3 may not launch as expected.

 If that’s the cause of your problem, you can try **adding Borderlands 3 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** . (Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.)

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 8: Install the latest game patch

 Gearbox Software keeps releasing game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a new patch might be able to fix Borderlands 3 not launching issue.

 If a new patch is available, you can just download and install it to see if it fixes your problem; if there are no patches available, or if the issue persists after you installed the latest patch, try the next fix below.

### Fix 9: Perform a clean boot

 If Borderlands 3 still fails to launch, it may be caused by other software on your PC. You may need a clean boot to find out the problematic software. Here is how to do it:

 1) Press the**Windows** key +**R** at the same time to open the**Run** box. Type**msconfig** and hit**Enter** .

 2\. Enable services and applications that you’ve disabled**one by one** until you find the problematic one.

**Note** : Remember to restart your PC to apply the changes after enabling each service.

### Fix 10: Run system file checker

 Missing or damaged system files may lead to Borderlands not launching. To fix this problem, you can use the**system file checker** tool of Windows to check for any file corruption and thereby repair it.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo Key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![borderlands won't launch open cmd](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cmd.jpg)

 2) Click**Yes** when you are prompted for permission.

 3) In the Command Prompt window, type the following command (**note** that there’s a space between**sfc** and**/** ) and press**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 4) Wait for the system scan to finish. Windows will try repairing your corrupted and missing files during the process.

![not launching](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/verification-image.png)

 5) When the verification is finished, you may receive the following messages:

* **Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations** .  
 It means you don’t have any missing or corrupted system files. You can go ahead with the next fix to solve your problem.
* **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them**  
 You can perform a restart and try to relaunch Borderland 3 to see if it’s fixed.

 If you receive neither of these messages, you can click **[Microsoft Support Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system)**  to further fix your problem with File Checker Tool.

---

### Fix 11: Reinstall the game

 If none of the fixes above works for you, you may need to try reinstalling the game to solve this problem.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the**Run** box.

 2) Type**appwiz.cpl** and press**Enter** .

![borderlands 3 not launching fix](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-998.png)

 3) Right-click**Borderlands 3** , then click**Uninstall** .

 Normally, Borderlands 3 can work properly again after you reinstall it. If it still doesn’t work, you may uninstall Epic Games as well.
