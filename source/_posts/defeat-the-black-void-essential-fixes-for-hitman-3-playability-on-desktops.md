## Fixes to try

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work down the list until you land on the one that fixes the issue.

1. [**Update your graphics driver (PC)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-dev-error-6034-in-warzone-pc-xbox/#fix1)
2. [**Remove broken game files (PC)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-dev-error-6034-in-warzone-pc-xbox/#fix2)
3. **[Remove Multiplayer game packs (Xbox)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-dev-error-6034-in-warzone-pc-xbox/#fix3)**
4. **[Reinstall Warzone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver (PC)

 One of the most common causes of game crashing is that you’re using a**broken or outdated graphics driver** . So before you further into anything more complicated, make sure you’re using the latest GPU driver. This could help avoid a lot of strange issues.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 2: Remove broken game files (PC)

 There’s information saying that the 6034 error is related to game files, which means you might fix it by a**scan and repair** . But before that, you need to delete some game files manually to ensure Blizzard downloads the latest version:

1. Open the installation folder of Modern Warfare or Warzone. Find and delete the following files:  
   * **.patch.result**  
   * **.product**  
   * **vivoxsdk\_x64.dll**  
   * **Launcher.db**  
   * **Launcher.exe (Modern Warfare)**
2. Launch your**Battle.net** client.
3. In the left pane, select **Call of Duty: MW** . Then click **Options**  and select **Scan and Repair** from the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/warzone-verify-1.jpg)
4. Wait for the process to complete. Then launch Warzone and check if it’s working now.

 If this method doesn’t do the trick, you can take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: Remove Multiplayer game packs

 Soon after the Dev Error happens, console gamers discovered that they can fix the issue by**removing specific game packs** . This would be less painful than a complete reinstallation, so you can give it a shot. If you don’t know how, here’s a quick example on Xbox:

1. On your Xbox, select Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Press the menu button and select**Manage game & add-ons** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6034-xbox-remove-packs-1.jpg)
2. Select**Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** . (You might also need to select**Manage installation on External drive** .)

3. Scroll down and unselect**MP2 Pack** and**Multiplayer Pack 3.** Then select**Save changes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6034-xbox-remove-packs-3.jpg)
4. Now restart your Xbox and check if Warzone is working now.
