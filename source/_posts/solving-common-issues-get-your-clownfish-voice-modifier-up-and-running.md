 If your internet speed is too low, you can try to[speed up the internet](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or just call your ISP.

Here are two ways to update your network drivers.

#### **Option 1- Manually download and install the driver**

 You can update your network drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. It will take time and effort.
