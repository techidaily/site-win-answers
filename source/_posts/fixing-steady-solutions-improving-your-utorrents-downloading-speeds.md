### Fix 4: Update your driver

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, the game may not run smoothly and stuck on the loading scree. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-far-cry-5-stuck-on-loading-screen/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-Geoforce.jpg)
4. Relaunch the game and check whether it will solve the problem.

### Fix 5: Set the Graphics Options to low settings

 If you were not stuck on the “beginning screen” but could enter the game, you could try this fix. The high graphics settings in your Far Cry 5 can take up many system resources, but it can slow down your gram or even crashing because insufficient system resource can be provided. With that, you should set the Graphics Options settings in Far Cry 5 in lower mode to make your game smoother and avoid stacking on the loading screen.

1. Open **Settings** in Far Cry 5, and click **Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b40699cd971c.jpg)
2. Click **Video** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4069c1c77c8.jpg)
3. Click the **Monitor** tab, and set **Window Mode to Windowed Mode** , and adjust the **Display Resolution** to the display resolution of your computer display, or lower than that.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4069fca7979.jpg)
4. Click the **Quality** tab, and adjust the available settings to **Low** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b406d6fb59e8.jpg)
5. Click the **Advanced** **Settings** tab, and **turn off V-Sync** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b406db724ad4.jpg)
6. Save the changes, restart your computer and open Far Cry 5 again to see if it fixes your issue.

### Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 If you’re overclocking your CPU or GPU, you need to stop doing this for a shot. Overclocking means setting your CPU and memory to run at speeds higher than their official speed grade. Almost all processors ship with a speed rating. However, this may cause your games stuck on loading or crashing, so you should **set your CPU clock speed rate back to default** to see if this could help.
