## Fix 2: Update your drivers

 The outdated or faulty graphics driver may be causing the Dota 2 FPS dropping issue. If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Dota 2 release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Dota 2 again to see whether the FPS is back to normal. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Turn off the Steam Overlay

 If you have the Steam Overlay turned on and FPS drops while playing Dota 2, just try disabling Steam Overlay for Dota 2 to see FPS increases. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Dota 2_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![steam dota2 properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/steam-dota2-properties.jpg)
2. In the GENERAL section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable steam overlay in Dota 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-steam-overlay-in-Dota-2.jpg)

 Launch Dota 2 to see if the game runs smoothly. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Modify Steam launch options for Dota 2

 You can also try using Steam launch options for Dota 2\. If you want a full FPS boost, you can follow the steps below to Launch the game:

1. Launch the Steam client and go to Steam **Library** . **Right-click** on**Dota 2** and select **Properties** .
2. In the **GENERAL** section, enter the command into the textbox under **SET LAUNCH OPTIONS** .  
`**-map dota -high -dx11 +fps_max #**`  
![modify dota 2 steam launch options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/modify-dota-2-steam-launch-options1.jpg)

**Explanation** :

`**-map dota**` : lets Steam load the Dota 2 map right when you launch the game.

`**-high**` : gives Dota 2 high priority CPU usage.

`**-dx11**` : forces your Windows OS run Dota 2 with the Direct3D (-dx11) rendering API. Use this command if your graphics card supports the rendering API DirectX 11.

`**+fps_max #**` : sets the maximum frame per second to the number that has been assigned. You can set the value # to 0 in order to uncap the FPS in the game, or let’s say 144 to cap your frame rate to a specific value. You can try to cap your frame rate to a value your computer can consistently hold.

 Launch Dota 2 to see if you get a better FPS. If not, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Modify the graphics settings

 If the FPS in Dota2 still doesn’t improve, you may need to modify the graphics settings. If you don’t know how, just follow the steps below.
