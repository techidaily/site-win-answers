## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

 The graphics card manuafacturers like Nvidia and AMD keeps releasing new graphics drivers so that they can fix bugs in the previous versions of graphics drivers and enhance graphics performance for their products.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and **you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 2: Verify the game files

 The game crash issue can also be caused by the corrupted game files. To fix this issue, you need to verify the game files. Here is how to do it:

1. In Steam, navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** and **right-click** on _DIRT 5_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam->properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-122.png)

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Dirt 5 release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Dirt 5 again to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.
