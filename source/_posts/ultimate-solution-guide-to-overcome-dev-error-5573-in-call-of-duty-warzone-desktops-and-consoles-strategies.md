### Fix 1 – Avoid PC overheating

 Black Ops Cold War is a graphic-intensive application that will put load on your CPU and GPU. When these component overheats, the computer will stop functioning to protect the hardware from physical damage, and thus your game freezes.

 To avoid this problem, you can**clean the dust regularly** and**check the cooling system** to ensure your PC is in a cool, well-ventilated condition. Also,**stop overclocking your processor** as this will increase the chance of overheating.

 If Call of Duty Cold War just freezes without any overheating symptoms, take a look at other workable fixes.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics card driver

 If you’re using a faulty graphics driver or it’s out-of-date, you may encounter various issues when playing Black Ops Cold War such as freezing, crashing or low FPS. GPU manufacturers have released new drivers optimized for this game, so you can update the graphics card driver to see if that fixes your issue.

There are two ways for you to do this:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can get the latest graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then, choose the correct driver that is compatible with your Windows version and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 3 – Disable fullscreen optimizations

Here are the steps:

1. Right-click the**CoD Black Ops Cold War icon** on your desktop and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/14.jpg)

 After the process completes, relaunch the game to test the issue. If this fix doesn’t help, check out the last one.

### Fix 5 – Lower the in-game graphics settings

 Many players report Call of Duty Cold War can hardly run smoothly on the high or ultra graphics settings. So if you’ve attempted all the fixes above with no success, you may need to sacrifice the visuals and opt for the lower settings.

1. While in game, press**F3** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select the**Graphics** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Lower the parameters under each section according to your needs.

 Check how things go. If the freezing problem is persistent, you can contact **[Blizzard’s support](https://support.activision.com/contact-us)**  for further assistance. Since Black Ops Cold War is a relatively new game, we’d wait for the upcoming patches to resolve those known bugs.
