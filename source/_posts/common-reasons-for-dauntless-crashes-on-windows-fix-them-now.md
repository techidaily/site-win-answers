### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, Warzone won’t work properly with your GPU when you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . So first you need to make sure you have the latest correct graphics driver. The newest driver usually helps improve compatibility and boost in-game performance.

 You can update the GPU driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), searching your graphics card and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can update the GPU driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
