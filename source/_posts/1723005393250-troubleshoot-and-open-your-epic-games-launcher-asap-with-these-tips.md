## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 When you have a black screen, whether on your computer or any app, your outdated or faulty graphics driver might be the culprit. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your graphics driver, then you should do it. And you can benefit a lot from updating the graphics driver. Because it can fix performance bottlenecks and introduce improvements that make games run significantly faster.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , and[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver** (recommended)

 Manually updating drivers can be a challenge. You’ll need to identify your system specs, find the drivers, and then download and install them. If that sounds a lot, consider doing it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/update-all-NVIDIA-RTX-2080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer for them to take effect.

## Fix 10: Use a VPN

 Many players reported that using a VPN when opening the launcher fixed the issue. So you can give it a shot. But be advised: lots of problems may arise if you use a free VPN. Therefore, we suggest you use a paid VPN.

Below is the VPN we would like to recommend:

* **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 There are reports claiming that using a VPN might result in accounts being banned. To be safe, consider it as the last resort.
