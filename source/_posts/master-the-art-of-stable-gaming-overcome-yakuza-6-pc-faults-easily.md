## Bonus: Update your driver

 If you want to get a better gaming experience, it is very important to keep your drivers updated. Windows 10 doesn‚Äôt always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter issues like won‚Äôt launch or black screen.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 ‚Äì Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ‚Äì You‚Äôll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 ‚Äì Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-you-do-not-have-permission-to-play-fortnite-error/#op2)**  ‚Äì This is the quickest and easiest option. It‚Äôs all done with just a couple of mouse clicks ‚Äì easy even if you‚Äôre a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 ‚Äì** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers on the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 ‚Äì Automatically update drivers**

 If you don‚Äôt have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
