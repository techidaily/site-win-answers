6. Launch the game in Steam Client and check if the Steam Fatal Error: Failed to Connect with Local Steam Client Process error is resolved. If it lingers on, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Launch the game in Steam again to see if the issue is resolved. If yes, then great. If the error still pops up, please try**Fix 5** , below.
