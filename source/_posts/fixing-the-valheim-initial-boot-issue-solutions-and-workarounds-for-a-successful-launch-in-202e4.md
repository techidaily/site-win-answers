### Method 4: Update your graphics card drivers

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, your game may encounter freezes. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-fallout-3-freezes-on-windows-10/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
