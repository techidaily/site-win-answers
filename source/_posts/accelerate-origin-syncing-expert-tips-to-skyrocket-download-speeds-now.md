 This is the first thing you should try when you have a black screen issue on Call of Duty: WWII. To do this:

1. When your game is running, press the**Alt** and**Tab** keys on your keyboard at the same time to switch out of the game.
2. Press the**Alt** and**Tab** keys on your keyboard at the same time to switch back into your game.

### Fix 2: Switch to the windowed mode, then switch back to the full screen mode

 A black screen is usually caused by some temporary graphics settings issue. And this can usually be fixed by switching between the windowed and full screen mode. To do so:

1. When your game is running, press the**Alt** and**Enter** keys on your keyboard at the same time to go to the windowed mode.
2. Press the**Alt** and**Enter** keys on your keyboard at the same time to switch back to the full screen view.

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 Perhaps you’re having the black screen issue on your game because you’re using a wrong device driver or it’s out of date. If that’s the case for you, you should update your device drivers on your computer.

There are two ways you can update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/call-of-duty-wwii-black-screen-issues-on-windows-solved/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

##### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Your device manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

##### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
