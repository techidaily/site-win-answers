| **OS**         | Windows 10                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**  | Intel CoreTM i5-3470 or AMD RyzenTM 3 1200        |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB RAM                                          |
| **Graphics**   | GeForce GTX 1050 3 GB or AMD RadeonTM RX 560 4 GB |
| **DirectX**    | Version 12                                        |
| **Storage**    | 80 GB available space                             |
| **Sound Card** | DirectX compatible                                |

RECOMMENDED System Requirements

 You can learn from the tables above that the DirectX version must be**Version 12** . Users with lower DirectX versions are experiencing more crashes while playing Death Stranding. So to better ensure you have the right DirectX version installed, you should take two steps below:

### Step 1: Check your DirectX version

 If you have no idea which version of DirectX you’ve installed, here’s how you can check:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to invoke the**Run** dialog box.

 2) Type**dxdiag** and press**Enter** to launch the**DirectX Diagnostic Tool** .

![Check DirectX Version ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DirectX-12-3.jpg)

 If your DirectX is not Version 12, take**step 2** to update it.

### Step 2: Update your DirectX version

If your DirectX is not Version 12, you should update it.

 1) Go to the Microsoft DirectX[download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .

 2) Scroll down and in the**DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer** section, select your language and click**Download** .

## Fix 2: Allow your game through the firewall or disable anti-virus software

 Windows Firewall or antivirus software is developed to detect and remove computer viruses. But there are situations when they fail to grant the authority to legitimate applications like your games. So if it happens to you, you should allow your game through[Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and disable your[antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) temporarily.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Video games are graphics-intensive. If your game keeps crashing, the possibility is that your graphics driver is corrupt or outdated. In this case, you need to update your graphics driver as your problem could be solved immediately.

There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/death-stranding-crashing/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the drivers manually

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official websites, find the correct drivers, and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the drivers, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers.

 If you’re an Nvidia user, you can also update your driver from the[Geforce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) application. What’s more, Death Stranding is one of the games that can take advantage of[optimal settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/games/) .

### **Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

## Fix 4: Clear temp files from your PC

Here’s how you can do it:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together on your keyboard to open the**Run** dialogue box.

 2) Type**%temp%** and press**Enter** .

![delete temp files Death Stranding crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/delete-temp-files-2-2.jpg)

 Granting the launcher with administrative rights can resolve many issues including the game crashing issue.
