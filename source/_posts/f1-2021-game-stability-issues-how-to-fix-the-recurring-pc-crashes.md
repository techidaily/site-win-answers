## 1\. Check system requirements

 Cities: Skylines 2 has rather high requirements for your computer CPU, especially when compared to other games. So if your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Cities: Skylines 2 to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

## 2\. Make sure your computer is not running hot

 If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Cities: Skylines 2 doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Cities: Skylines 2 crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help Cities: Skylines 2 to stop crashing, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.
