 If it’s not a server problem, a VPN may help you fix the issue. Using a VPN would change the server you linked and make a difference. A paid VPN provides you a safe and better internet performance.

[**Express VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) are big brands with good reputations.

 Here we take **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as an example:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN on your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.

 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.

### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves.

 You can manually update your driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website or do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
