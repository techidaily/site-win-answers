## 1\. Check the NBA 2K server status

 The first thing to do when you see error code 727e66ac in NBA 2K24 is to check the server status of NBA 2K, to see if the problem can be fixed by you.

 To check NBA 2K’s server status, simply go here:[https://www.nba2k.com/gamestatus](https://www.nba2k.com/gamestatus)

 If NBA 2K’s server is down, then there’s not much you can do other than wait for it to be fixed, given that it’s a universal problem and all the other gamers are experiencing the same problem. If the NBA 2K server is still up and running, but error code 727e66ac persists in NBA 2K24, please move on to the other fixes below.

---

## 2\. Revisit your network settings

 If you’ve made sure that NBA 2K’s server is running just fine, but you’re still getting the error code 727e66ac, you may need to revisit your network settings, as it could be a network issue on your end.

 Here is a list of tweaks that you can do with your router to improve your network connectivity, and thus reduce the chance of getting error code 727e66ac in NBA 2K24\. Check the following to see if you’ve done them all:

* **Don’t use any VPN or proxy services** : such services could be blocked by NBA 2K’s servers, and therefore increase the chance of network problems like error code 727e66ac in NBA 2K24.
* **Reduce the number of devices connected to the same router** to ensure your main computer gets the most speed.
* **Use a wired network connection** (with an Ethernet cable) instead of Wi-Fi. If this is not an option, move your computer closer to the router.
* **Play on your local server** . If that’s not an option, choose one that is closest to you.
* **Update your router firmware** if you haven’t already.
* In your router settings, try to **enable QoS to prioritize gaming traffic** . If you’re not sure where to find it, please visit your router’s official website to find the manual or seek help from your ISP.
* **Update the game** , if you haven’t already.

 If none of the above helps, and you’re still seeing the error code 727e66ac in NBA 2K24, please move on.

## 3\. Change the DNS server

 The default DNS server appointed by the ISP (Internet service provider) could have problems like crowded caches and temporary server outages, which could cause network problems like error code 727e66ac in NBA 2K24\. To see if this is an issue for you, you can first flush the DNS, and then switch to a public DNS server.

To do so:

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and **R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **cmd** , then press **Shift** and **Enter** at the same time. If prompted for permission, click **Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/run-cmd.png)
3. Copy **ipconfig /flushdns** , and paste it in the pop-up window. Then press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/flushdns%E7%9A%84%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC.png)
4. Your DNS cache is successfully cleared.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Select **Use the following DNS server addresses** , fill in the Google DNS server addresses as below, then click **OK** .  

 **Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8**  
 **Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4**

## 6\. Repair damaged or corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues with NBA2K24 and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process.

However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .
