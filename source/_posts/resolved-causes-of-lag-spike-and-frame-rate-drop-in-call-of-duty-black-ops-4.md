| **Graphics**  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                        |
| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space             |

 Halo Infinite supports indicates some minimum hardware specification GPUs may crash when playing intro cinematic sequences in 4k resolution.

You can fix it by uninstalling the multiplayer HD texture packs.

## Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
