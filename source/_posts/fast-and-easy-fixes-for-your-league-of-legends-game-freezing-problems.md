### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact PC model and your version of Windows.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .
