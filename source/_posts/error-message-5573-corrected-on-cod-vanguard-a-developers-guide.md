3. [**Disable Ray Tracing**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

6. [**Disable in-game overlays**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [**Repair your system files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1\. Remove the operator skin

 For those who’re getting 0x00001338 (5573) N error code, according to many Vanguard players, the game works right after they remove the operator skin and switch back to the base skin.

 You can change the operator skin by selecting a default one. The operator skin is the major cause of this error code, and you shall be playing the game without any error codes when you use the base skin.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 2\. Clear the game cache

 If you’re still running into Vanguard error codes, it might be caused by your game cache. A quick fix is to delete the “Players” folder. Here’s how:

1) Make sure the game is not running.

2) On your keyboard, press the Windows + R key at the same time and enter**%programdata%** .

![open program data folder](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-10.png)

 3) Navigate to**Blizzard Entertainment** \>**Battle.net** \>**Cache**
`(C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache)`

 4) Delete every folder or file under the**Cache** folder.

### Fix 3\. Disable Ray Tracing

 Another possible cause of Vanguard Error Code 0x00001338 N is your game settings. By turning off Ray Tracing, you may find the game is working like charm again.

 If you are experiencing the error on a non-RTX GPU, then try reducing the GPU clock by 50 MHz using MSI Afterburner to fix the error.

### Fix 4\. Update device drivers

 For any avid gamers, we can’t emphasize the importance of keeping your graphics driver and audio driver up to date more. Manufacturers deliver new drivers to optimize your gaming experience and fix known bugs, especially for new games such as CoD Vanguard.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([**NVIDIA**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install manually, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/driver-easy-5.7.1.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![update all drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

After updating your drivers, restart your PC and test the gameplay.

### Fix 5\. Revert to DX11

 One reason for the Call of Duty Vanguard in-game error code 0x00001338 N is DirectX 12\. The game uses DX12 by default and doesn’t have any option in-game to change it to DirectX 11\. Here’s how to force revert back to DX11 manually:

 1) Open Battle.net client and select COD Vanguard, and select**Options** .

 2) Click Game Settings, and tick additional command-line arguments. Then add**\-d3d11** and click done.

![set lauch options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-11-1200x639.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Launch CoD Vanguard and test the gameplay.

### Fix 6\. Disable in-game overlays

 Using in-game overlays like Geforce Experience overlay or third-party tools and software like MSI Afterburner or any RGB software can cause Cod Vanguard error codes issues.

 Disable in-game overlays and any third-party tools (listed below) you are using and Call of Duty Vanguard won’t interfere with CoD Vanguard anymore.

### Fix 7\. Repair your system files

 If none of these fixes above fixed your problem, you may need to check for any corrupt game files and restore them. Your game might be sharing the same system file (DLL), thus causing you the Vanguard error codes. There are mainly two ways for you to fix a corrupt/missing system file:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/cod-vanguard-error-code-0x00001338-n/#restoro)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of your exact problem. It will deal with issues related to system errors, critical system files and find the right fit for you.
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry keys, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

 Fortect is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues (powered by Avira Antivirus), and finally it detects programs that crash and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

 Fortect is a trusted repair tool and it will do no harm to your PC. The best part is that you won’t need to worry about losing any programs and your personal data.

* Fortect will replace your missing/damaged DLL files with fresh, clean, and up-to-date ones
* Fortect will replace ALL DLL files that are missing and/or damaged – Even those you don’t know about!

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. This might take 3\~5 minutes to fully analyze your PC. Once complete, you will be able to review the detailed scan report.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)

 3) You’ll see the summary of detected issues on your PC. Click **START REPAIR** and all the issues will be fixed automatically. (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Check will begin to scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to check the device performance and health of your PC.

##### Step 2.**Run dism.exe**

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restoring heath gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 If the System File Check finds any files corrupted, follow the on-screen instructions to repair them, and then restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.
