## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics processing unit (GPU), or your graphics card, has the most impact on your gameplay experience. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, it could result in rendering glitches. So try updating your graphics driver and then running the game again.

 You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, (such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)**  , [**Intel**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) or **[Nvidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ,) and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-57-32.jpg)
3. Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-58-08.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Relaunch Warzone to test your issue. If the texture fails to load as intended, try the next fix below.

4. Save your change and relaunch the game to test the issue.

 If adjusting the game settings didn’t resolve your issue, then try the next fox below.

3. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_10-52-19.jpg)

## Fix 5:**Switch to your dedicated GPU**

 Gameplay is a demanding task that requires a strong GPU. If you have more than one GPU, an integrated and a dedicated one, it could be that the game is running with the wrong GPU.

 In this case, you can switch your GPU to the dedicated one to see if it fixes your issue. Here’s how to switch to the dedicated[**Nvidia GPU**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[AMD GPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Switch to the dedicated Nvidia GPU**

1. Right-click an empty space on your desktop and select**Nvidia Control Panel** .
2. Navigate to**3D Settings > Manage 3D Settings.**
3. Open the**Program Settings** tab and choose**Warzone** from the dropdown menu.
4. Select the**preferred graphics processor for this program** from the second dropdown. (Your Nvidia GPU should show as**High performance Nvidia processor** .)
5. Save your changes.

 Your game should now run with the dedicated Nvidia GPU. Launch it to see if the texture error still exists. If it does, check **[Fix 6](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Switch to the dedicated AMD GPU**

1. Right-click an empty space on your desktop and select**Radeon Settings** .
2. Navigate to **Preferences > Additional Settings > Power > Switchable Graphics Application Settings** .
3. Select**Warzone** from the list of applications. (If Warzone is not in the list, click the**Add Application button** and select the Warzone.exe file from its installation directory. Then, select it.)
4. In the**Graphics Settings** section, assign the**High Performance profile** to Warzone.

 Your game should now run with the dedicated AMD GPU. Launch it to see if the texture problem got fixed. If not, check the next solution below.

##

 Fix 6: Stop overclocking your GPU

 An unstable overclock can also cause gaming issues, such as texture not loading properly. If you have overclocked your card, return it to default clocks and see if the problem goes away. If it does, you will have to apply some more voltage to your card if you want to maintain your overclock.
