## Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when you’re experiencing in-game fps drops. Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 According to the latest graphics driver release notes from Nvidia and AMD, **both graphics manufacturers provide optimal support for Resident Evil Village:**

> This new Game Ready Driver provides support for the Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, which adds additional ray-traced effects and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 for greater performance and improved image quality. Additionally,**this release also provides optimal support for** Mass Effect Legendary Edition and**Resident Evil Village** , along with support for 5 new G-SYNC Compatible displays.
>
> Release 465 Driver for Windows, Version 466.27\. Release Notes from Nvidia

> Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 21.5.1 Highlights:**Support Resident Evil Village™** . **Up to 13% increase in performance in Resident Evil Village @ 4K MAX settings** , with Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 21.5.1 on the 16GB Radeon™ RX 6800XT graphics card, versus the previous software driver edition 21.4.1.RS-362
