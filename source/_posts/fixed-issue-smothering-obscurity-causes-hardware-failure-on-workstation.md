![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b767fa979eda-300x179.jpg)

 When you’re in the mood for a movie or TV, you usually launch Kodi. But if Kodi crashes every time you launch it or in the middle of an episode, it’s really annoying. If you’re experiencing the same issue, don’t worry, it’s fixable! And in most cases, the fix is pretty fast and simple…

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 fixes that have helped many Kodi users get their Kodi working again. You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Update Kodi**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Remove addons**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Disable hardware acceleration**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. [**Reinstall Kodi**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Update Kodi to the latest version

 If Kodi keeps crashing, it may be caused by software bugs. You should update Kodi to the latest version and see if this is causing your problem.

1. Click this **[link](https://kodi.tv/download)**  to download the latest version of Kodi on PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b768d3b4640b.jpg)
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Kodi.
3. Launch Kodi and check if it now works properly. If not, try Fix 2, below.

### Fix 2: Remove recently installed addons

 If Kodi crashes soon after you install an add-on, the add-on is probably the culprit. To see if this is causing your problem, you should remove the add-on’s directory from Kodi’s**userdata** folder:

1. Close Kodi.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to access **File Explorer** .
3. In the address bar, type**%APPDATA%\\Kodi\\userdata**  then press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc048ab00113.jpg)
4. Double-click on the**addon\_data** folder, and select the add-on directory that you think might be causing Kodi to crash, and press**Del** to delete it.

 If you’re not sure which one is the culprit, you can go back to the **userdata** folder to open the**Database** folder in it.

 then delete the **Addons27** file.

1. Click the**gear icon** to go to the settings menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7aa65d2a1b9.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7aa7a1d4a61.png)
4. Highlight the **Video** tab, then on the right side, in the **Processing** section, turn off **Allow hardware acceleration -DXVA2** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7aa89e02e8f.jpg)

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 If the steps above didn’t work for you, the most likely cause is a graphics driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix.

 There are two ways to update your graphics driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your graphics driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your graphics driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6b94e4d9d8.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This require the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. )
