### Fix 2: Verify your game files

 The constant crash may indicate an**integrity issue with your game files** . If that’s the case, your game might keep crashing at a certain scene or chapter. You should make sure there’s nothing wrong with your game files.

Here’s an example of how to check the game integrity on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client. Navigate to the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click**Detroit: Become Human** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/detroit-become-human-verify-game-01.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab, then select**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/detroit-become-human-verify-game-02.jpg)
3. Wait until the checking to finish.

You can then launch Detroit: Become Human and see if it crashes again.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 3:**Close all** background**applications**

 Detroit: Become Human is a demanding game, and the crash can occur when you have some other large programs eating up your CPU resources and RAM. So if you’re running big programs like**Chrome** ,**Discord** or**Windows Update** , be sure to close them before launching your game.

If this fix failed to solve your issue, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 More often than not, the crash of new games tends to be graphics-related. It usually indicates that you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Whether you’re using a 1,000 dollars gaming rig or just a five-year-old school laptop, always make sure you make the most out of it, with the latest graphics driver.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, first visit your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Remember to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. And always restart your PC after updating device drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-all-rtx-3090.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

### Fix 6: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlay is a feature that makes it convenient to purchase game items and interact with friends on third party platforms. But in some cases, it might become the cause of instability. If you’re using in-game overlays such as**Steam** ,**Discord** or**NVIDIA GeForce Experience** , you can try to disable them and see if it fixes your problem.

For example, you can follow these steps to disable Steam overlay:

1. Open your**Steam client** . In the top left corner, click**Steam** select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steam-disable-overlay.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select**In-Game** . Under**The Steam Overlay** section, uncheck these boxes. Then click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disabel-steam-overlay.jpg)
3. Launch Detroit: Become Human and test your gameplay.

If the crashing reappears, please check out the next fix.

### Fix 7: Disable your controller

 Some gamers reported that they managed to stop the crash in Detroit: Become Human by**unplugging their controllers** . It’s true that a controller give you a better experience, but they would sometimes run into compatibility issues with new games. Given that, if you’re using controllers or joysticks, you can try to unplug them before starting the game.

### Fix 8: Roll back your graphics driver

 According to some players, one potential fix is rolling back the graphics driver. If you’re using an NVIDIA GPU,**try version 446.14 or 451.67** . Also don’t forget to check if the driver supports your GPU.

 To roll back the driver, first download the NVIDIA driver version[**446.14**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[**451.67**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Then follow[this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to reinstall the graphics driver with DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller). Once done, check if Detroit: Become Human is working properly.
