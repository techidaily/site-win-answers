## Genshin Impact Hacked? Demystifying and Solving Error Code 4201 Now

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ce8ff1a22710f0446f4cfea7ad6cfdab_2580546458333734908.png)

 Many PC players have reported getting**Error 4201 on Genshin Impact** , which prevents them from even logging into the game. The error message may state “**Failed to connect, please check your network settings** ” or “**Failed to connect to the server** .” If you’re on the same boat, no worries! We’ve got some working fixes that you can try, just read on and find out what they are.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

[1: Check your Internet connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[2: Run the game executable as Admin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[3: Check your VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[4: Configure DNS settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[5: Update your network adapter driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 As mentioned in the introduction, Error 4201 on Genshin impact sometimes can be a server issue. When the server is down, there’s nothing much to do on the player-side. This article will only focus on the possible fixes that players can do.

## Fix 1: Check your Internet connection

 Error 4201 is a connection issue, so the first thing you should check is to make sure your Internet is working fine. Here’s a few things that you can do to check your Internet connection:

* If you’re playing Genshin impact on Wi-Fi, you’ll likely encounter Error 4201, and other possible network issues due to instability or overcrowding. If possible,**play on a wired connection** .
* You can**power cycle your router and modem** to see if it helps. Unplug the power cables from both devices, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then plug the cables back into both devices.
* If you can only access Wi-Fi, then you need to make sure your Wi-Fi connection is valid. You can disconnect your PC from Wi-Fi, and**connect to your mobile hotspot** to test the issue. If the error is gone, then there’s something wrong with your Wi-Fi.
* When your connection seems to be slow and you doubt it’s the cause, you can use an online tool to**test your Internet speed** . If your Internet speed turns out to be unreasonably low, consider contacting your ISP (Internet Service Provider) for assistance.

 If your Internet connection is valid and reliable but you still get Error 4201 on Genshin Impact, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Run the game executable as Admin

 Another possible cause of Error 4201 is the game being blocked on your PC. If Genshin Impact is blocked on your PC, it won’t be able to connect to the server. You may need to give administrative permissions to Genshin Impact on your PC, and it’s important to do this to the game executable itself instead of the game shortcut. Here’s how:

1. Open your Genshin Impact installed path, then go to**Genshin ImpactGenshin Impact Game** .
2. Find the game executable file, right-click it then select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-20_16-49-02.jpg)
3. Go to the**Compatibility** tab, and check the box of**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-20_16-51-47.jpg)

 If running the game executable as Admin doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Check your VPN

 VPN seems to be a cause of Error 4201 on Genshin Impact, but it could also be a fix to this issue. No matter if you use VPN for Genshin Impact or not, you can refer to this fix to solve your problem.

 Many players would use VPN for Genshin Impact, but it turned out to be causing Error 4201 for some players. This is because Mihoyo may detect VPN connections and block your game instead. If you also use a VPN for this game, try disabling it and test the issue.

 On the other hand, VPN solved some players’ problems when they encountered geo-blocking or IP-blocking from Mihoyo out of security concerns. If you’ve never used a VPN for Genshin Impact, try using one and test if the error is gone. If you need VPN recommendations, our best pick is[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , one of the most reliable and fastest VPN services on the market.

 NordVPN is now holding a[limited-time sale](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , so don’t miss the deal and grab the offer! Also you can visit[DE Coupon page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for the latest coupons and promo codes.

 If disabling or using a VPN doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Configure DNS settings

 Your ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) default DNS server is not always the best. There are many public DNS servers that are safe and good for gaming. Using the Quad9 DNS may help solve Error 4201 on Genshin Impact, and it already helped many players with this issue, so it’s worth trying. Here’s how:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**network icon** , then click**Open Network & Internet settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-network-settings.png)
2. Click**Change adapter options** .

## Fix 5: Update your network adapter driver

 If you’ve tried the fixes above but nothing worked, you may try to update your network adapter driver. Making sure your network adapter driver is working properly could help solve Error 4201 on Genshin Impact.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your network adapter driver[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Just note that the Windows database is not updated as frequently, so you may actually need a driver update but Device Manager can’t detect any.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your network adapter, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the network adapter driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. For example, you can update your graphics driver as well (see as below.)  
 (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg)
