 An old, corrupted or missing video card driver on your computer may also cause the DirectDraw error. If this is the case, we recommend your**update your video card driver to the latest version** .

**Manual driver update –** You can update your video driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your video card, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.
