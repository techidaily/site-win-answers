## Microbes Decompose Organic Matter, Fix Atmospheric Nitrogen, and Help Suppress Plant Diseases, Contributing to a Cycle of Nutrients and Maintaining Soil Health

Many Destiny 2 players are reporting that they get the error ‘ **You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers. Your permissions to access online multiplayer gameplay may have changed or your profile may have been signed in elsewhere.** ‘ and wonder how to solve this error instead of waiting for a few minutes, perhaps for days.

## Why am I receiving this error?

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/attention.jpg)

 Check the[status of the Destiny 2 servers](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049199271) . If the server itself is not down at the moment, the potential causes of the ‘You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers’ error are listed below:

* Your account does not have an active PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold subscription, or the subscription has expired
* The account has been signed into another console
* PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live may be undergoing maintenance or connection issues
* The consoles were recently switched between a wired or wireless connection without the console’s network settings being updated to match the new connection type
* Internet-related issues

 If you’re encountering this error constantly, you may want to use the following troubleshooting steps:

## Fix 1\. Clear the cache

 If you have an active membership and you’re quite sure that you’re not using your account on any other consoles ([how to prevent unauthorized logins](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360048721292) ) but the error code persists, you can try clearing the cache to see if it helps:

#### Clearing the console cache

1. Power off the console
2. Once the console is completely powered down, unplug the power cord from the back of the console
3. Let the console sit unplugged for at least 5 minutes
4. Plug the power cord back into the console and power it on
5. Re-launch the Destiny 2 game

#### Clearing the Steam cache

1. From your Steam Client, go to**Setting > Downloads** from the top left client menu.
2. Click the**CLEAR DOWNLOAD CACHE** button at the bottom.  
![steam clear cache](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/clear_download_cache.jpg)
3. Then select**OK** to confirm and acknowledge that you’ll need to log in to Steam again.  
![confirm clear cache](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/confirm_clear_cache.jpg)

 This process will not affect your currently installed games, but you will need to log into Steam afterwards.

## Fix 2\. Switch to a wired connection

 While Destiny can be played with a strong and stable WiFi connection, many players have found that using WiFi can increase the likelihood that they will lose their connection to Destiny’s services. So we recommend a wired connection if possible. In addition, Destiny requires sufficient bandwidth to function at an optimal level.

 However, if you need to play it on WiFi, you may want to improve the stability of your WiFi connection:

* Move the console/computer as close as possible to the WiFi source.
* Turn off or disable all other devices connected to the WiFi network while playing Destiny 2.
* Avoid obstructions between the console/computer and the WiFi source whenever possible, especially large appliances or other electronics.

## Fix 3\. Update your network adapter driver

 If you are unable to get past sign-in due to “**Unable to Connect** ” and changing to a wired connection still doesn’t work then there might be something with your network adapter driver or your network settings. Try updating or reinstalling the network adapter driver and check if it fixes the ‘**You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers** ‘ error.

## Fix 4\. Perform a network reset

 Performing a network reset potentially fixes any strange settings that may be preventing you from connecting, thus solve your ‘**You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers** ‘ error. Here’s how:

1. In the Windows search box, type**cmd** . Under**Command Prompt** , select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-as-admin-cmd.jpg)
2. Click**OK** to confirm your action.
3. Once the Command Prompt window is open, type the following command lines (press**Enter** after entering each command line):  
**`netsh winsock reset`**  
**`netsh int ip reset`**  
**`ipconfig /release`**  
**`ipconfig /renew`**  
**`ipconfig /flushdns`**  
![reset network](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/reset.png)
4. You’ll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

## Fix 5\. Change your DNS server

 Some Destiny players find it helps when they change the DNS server to Google 8.8.8.8 and 4.4.4.4\. Below you’ll find the exact steps to do that:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R** key at the same time to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type in**ncpa.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ncpa.jpg)
3. Right-click your current network connection, and select**Properties** .  
![properties of network connection](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/properties-1.png)
4. Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** .  
![ipv4](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IPV4-2.jpg)
5. Select **Use the following DNS server addresses** and fill in the Google DNS servers:  

**Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8**  
**Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4**

## Fix 6\. Enable UPnP or Port Forwarding

 If you worked hard through the basic troubleshooting guide but still the error ‘**You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers** ‘ persists, you can try setting up UPnP or Port Forwarding (we don’t recommend doing both of them).

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1\. Enable UPnP

1. In the Windows Seach bar, type in**cm** d and select**Command Prompt** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/command-prompt.jpg)
2. Get your Router’s internal IP (Default Gateway) by entering**ipconfig** in Command Prompt.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![default gateway is your router's ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/default-gateway.jpg)
3. Copy-paste the Default Gateway address into your computer’s browser, and log in with the correct user name and password.
4. Find the**UPnP** setting, usually located under the “LAN” or “Firewall” category.
5. Enable UPnP and click**Save** to apply the changes.
6. Disconnect and reconnect all devices on the network.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2\. Enable Port Forwarding

 If you can’t use UPnP or don’t feel like it, you can enable Port Forwarding to allow all the connections Destiny needs. Note that you **won’t be able to use more than one console to play Destiny on the same network simultaneously** when using Port Forwarding. If you need this feature, I suggest you choose

#### Step 1\. Information you’ll need

1. Type **cmd** in the Windows search bar and select **Command Prompt** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/command-prompt.jpg)
2. Type in **ipconfig /all** and press **Enter** .

![ip address](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/command-prompt.jpg)

**Note:** Default Gateway is your router’s IP Address, which you can copy-paste to your browser’s address bar.

#### Step 2\. Set up the static IP address

 It’s recommended that you also assign a Static IP address to your computer or console to make port forwarding easier.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows key + R to open the **Run**  box. Then enter **ncpa.cpl** , and select **OK**  to open Network Connections.

#### Step 3\. Set up Port Forwarding

1. On your web browser, enter the IP address of the router (**Gateway Address** ).
2. Enter the **admin credentials** (the username and password may differ based on the brand you are using).
3. Search for the **Port Forwarding**  or **Advanced** or **Virtual Server** section.  
![server](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/servers.jpg)
4. Enter the IP Address of your PC in the relevant box.
5. Choose both **TCP** and **UDP**  ports for your games in the appropriate box.  
![port forwading ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7777.jpg)
6. Once complete, enable the port forwarding rule with an **Enable** or **On** option.

 Did the workarounds above do the trick for you? If unfortunately no, you can try reinstalling the game. But if the error ‘**You have lost connection to the Destiny 2 servers.** ‘ persists, for the most time, the problem isn’t likely on your end, there’s no point in worrying further. You may need to wait for a few days for the problem to go away automatically.
