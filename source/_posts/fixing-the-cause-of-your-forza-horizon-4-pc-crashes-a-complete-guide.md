### Fix 2: Check your antivirus settings

 Your antivirus software could block the normal operation of State of Decay 2 and cause the game to keep crashing. To ensure that State of Decay 2 works properly, you should add it as an exception to your antivirus software. This will vary depending on the antivirus software you’re using.

 See if the game crashes after you add it as an exception to your antivirus software. If it persists, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you will possibly encounter this crashing issue in State of Decay 2\. To fix the potential problems and ensure the game functions properly, you should install the latest graphics driver on your computer.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest version of the graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
