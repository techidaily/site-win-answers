### Fix 1 – Stop overclocking

 An unstable overclocking will lead to excessive energy consumption and cause your programs to malfunction. So if you’ve overclocked your CPU or GPU and then Hitman 3 crashes, try**disabling overclocking utilities like MSI Afterburner** and **setting the clock speed back to the default** . If this doesn’t help, have a look at the second fix below.

### Fix 2 – Use the dedicated GPU

 If you have two graphics cards installed to your computer, make sure to run Hitman 3 on your dedicated GPU, because the inbuilt card is usually underpowered for graphics-intensive games and can trigger the crashing issue. Here’s how to switch to the dedicated card in NVIDIA settings:

1. Right-click any empty space on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nvidia-settings-1.jpg)
2. Select**3D settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** from the left pane.

3. Go to the**Programs Settings** tab. Then, click the**Add** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Hitman 3 crashing may also indicate an integrity issue with your game files, so it’s necessary for you to check and repair the missing or damaged game files.

1. Open your Epic Games Launcher and navigate to the**Library** tab in the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-1-2.jpg)
2. Mouse over the**Hitman 3 tile** and click**the icon with three dots** at the lower right corner. Then, select**Verify** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-2-2.jpg)
3. After the process completes, launch Hitman 3 to test.

 Does the game works the right way or does it still crash? If the latter, don’t frustrate and check out the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to your gaming experience. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, Hitman 3 is more likely to crash at startup and during the gameplay. To fix this, you should update your graphics driver to the latest, and here are two options for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : Graphics card manufacturers will keep optimizing their graphics drivers for the latest titles. To get the most recent drivers, you need to visit the manufacturers’ websites like[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) . Then, search for the driver that is compatible with your Windows version and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the_flagged graphics driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all the drivers_ that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After the driver update, you should see Hitman 3 runs more smoothly. But if this method doesn’t work, continue to the last fix below.

### Fix 5 – Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory, but when it runs low, the system performance may suffer and Hitman 3 will crash frequently. To see if that’s the case, you can increase the virtual memory via the steps below.

1. Click the**Start** button and type**advanced system settings** in the search bar. Then, click**View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1-3.jpg)
2. Click**Settings** under Performance.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-2-2.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Advanced** tab. Then, click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-3-2.jpg)
4. Untick**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Select the**C drive** and click**Custom size** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
6. Enter the **initial size** and **maximum size** depending on the amount of RAM your PC has. Then, click **OK** .  

**Note** : According to Microsoft, you should set virtual memory no less than**1.5 times** and no more than **3 times** the amount of RAM on your computer. For example, if you have 8 GB RAM, the**Initial size** should be 8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB while the **Maximum size** should be 8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB. If you don’t know how much RAM you have, read our post to[check RAM on your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Restart the computer for changes to take effect. Once you’ve done that, run Hitman 3 and the crashes should be resolved now.
