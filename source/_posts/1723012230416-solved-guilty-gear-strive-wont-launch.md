### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If Guilty Gear Strive keeps crashing while in-game, it’s likely that your graphics driver is faulty or outdated. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your drivers. There are two ways you can try.

**Manually** : You need to find the model of your graphics card and visit the manufacturer’s website( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ). Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically(Recommended)** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills, you can do it automatically with**Driver Easy** .

 Driver Easy is a useful tool that can automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money-back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version.

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your computer and launch Guilty Gear Strive again.

If the game still crashes, don’t worry, try the next fix.

### Fix 3: Perform a clean boot

 A clean boot is often used to diagnose and troubleshoot software conflict issues. To perform a clean boot means starting your computer only with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Then you can identify if there are any conflicts between your game and another program. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and type**System Configuration** , then click**Open** from the list of results.

2. In the System Configuration window, click the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as**Realtek** ,**AMD** ,**NVIDIA** and**Intel** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ok.jpg)
8. Restart your computer.

 After restarting your computer, launch the Guilty Gear Strive to see if it crashes.

 If the game doesn’t crash, you need to open the System Configuration window to enable services one by one until you find the problematic software. Then you need to restart your computer to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic program that causes the game to crash, you just need to uninstall it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.

 If the game still crashes after you disabled all the programs and services, try the next fix.

### Fix 4: Try different launch options

 To launch the game with different launch options has been proven to be another useful way to fix crashing issues. For example, we can add the console command “-d3d11” to force the game to run on DirectX 11\. Or we can add the console command “-nohmd” to launch the game with no head-mounted display, so it won’t need to boot up SteamVR. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open your**Steam Library** . Right-click Guilty Gear Strive and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lib.jpg)
2. On the General tab you’ll find the**LAUNCH OPTIONS** section. In the blank text box, type “**\-nohmd** ” or “**\-d3d11** ”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Close the game’s Properties window.

 Now you can launch Guilty Gear Strive again to see if it fixes the crashing issue.
