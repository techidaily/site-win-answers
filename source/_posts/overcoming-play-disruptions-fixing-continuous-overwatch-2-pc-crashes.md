 2) Relaunch your Origin and FIFA to check if the crashing issue still persists.

If you still have the issue, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 2 Turn off Discord Overlay and Hardware Acceleration

 The FIFA crashing issue can be caused by Discord settings. If you have Discord installed, you can turn off Discord Overlay and Hardware Acceleration.

 1) Open your Discord, and click the **settings** icon.

 2) Scroll down, select the **Game Overlay** tab, and turn**off** **Enable in-game overlay** .

### Fix 3 Allow FIFA 19 to run through the Firewall

 Temporarily disable your Anti-virus software or add your FIFA 19 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. (Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.)

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

---

### Fix 4 Update your device drivers

 If your FIFA 19 just keeps crashing, your device drivers (especially your graphics card driver) are likely outdated or corrupt. To fix it, you can update your drivers**manually** or**automatically** .

#### Option 1: Update your drivers manually

 To update your drivers manually, you can either go to Device Manager or visit the manufacturer’s official website to download and install the correct and latest driver.

#### Option 2: Update your drivers automatically

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pr** o version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back**guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, and then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

OR

 Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/driver-update.jpg)

### Fix 5 Rollback to DirectX11

 DX11 or DX12? What’s the difference? You may wonder. There is no visual difference, but using DX12 helps to improve the performance by 10-20 fps. However, FIFA 19 might crash randomly when in DX12\. To save your FIFA 19 from crashing, you can roll back to DX11 in your game settings.

 Your FIFA 19 should be working properly again now. If not, you can try the next fix.

---

### Fix 6 Force Vertical Sync and Triple Buffering on

 Vertical Sync helps you avoid screen tearing, but it can also cause problems such as frequent game crashing and freezing. To avoid it, you can leave V-Sync off in-game settings, then force Vertical Sync and Triple Buffering on in the NVIDIA Control Panel to use the drivers to control V-Sync instead.

1) Turn off V-Sync in the game settings menu.

2) Right-click on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NVIDIA-control-panel.jpg)

 3) Under the**Manage 3D settings** tab, click**Program Settings** .  
  
 Then click**Add** and select your**FIFA 19** exe. program file.  
  
 Scroll down the list and click**Vertical sync** and**Triple buffering** and select them both**On** .  
  
 Click**Apply** to save the changes.

### Fix 7**Run System File Checker** to repair corrupt files

 Corrupt system files might be the cause of the FIFA crashing issue. To check if this is your problem and repair it, here is how:

#### 1\. Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** +**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** in the box and then press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Enter** to run as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cmd-admin.jpg)

 2) Copy & paste**sfc /scannow** into the box and hit**Enter** . This takes about 3-5 min.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/scannow.jpg)

 3) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what the message is, you need to reboot your computer and run SFC again to get the same message.

 4) Run Command Prompt as administrator and enter**sfc /sannow** again.

* If you see **Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations** twice, it means there are no corrupt files. You can stop here and try the next fix.
* If it still finds errors, try and run it a few more times until it finds no errors 2 times in a row.

**Note:** Don’t forget to reboot between running the command.

* If System File Checker fails to repair the error it finds 3 times in a row, then you need to format or repair your computer.

 Alternatively, you can try a few commands to repair them if you’re on Windows 8, 8.1, or 10.

#### 2\. Repair the corrupt files

 1) Open Command Prompt as administrator and run the following commands to repair the corrupt files.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you will get some error messages.

* If restoring health gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get**Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 After repairing the corrupt files, you can relaunch your FIFA to see if the crashing issue persists. If everything works out just fine, then congrats! If it’s still crashing, don’t panic. There are a few more fixes you can try.

 If it fails to repair the corrupt files or your issue persists, you may need a more advanced repairing tool. Here we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a legit and safe repairing tool that can help you detect missing or corrupt system files and identify any critical issues on your system.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.

 3) If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click Start Repair to start the repair process.

### Fix 8**Perform a clean boot to check for conflicting programs**

 The FIFA 19 crashing issue can be caused by other conflicting programs. To check if that’s the cause, you can perform a clean boot. Here is how to do it:

 1) Type**msc** in the search box and select**System Configuration** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/system-config.jpg)

 2) Click the**Services** tab and check the**Hide all Microsoft services** box, then click**Disable all** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/disable-all-services.png)

 3) Click the**Startup** tab, then**Open Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/open-task-manager.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




 4) Under the **Startup** tab, select **each** startup item and then click **Disable** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/startup.png)

 5) Go back to **System Configuration** , then click **OK** to save the changes.

 6) Restart your computer and launch your FIFA 19 to see if is working perfectly again.

 If so, congrats! But you need to open System Configuration again to enable the services and applications one by one to find out the conflicting ones.

 Remember to RESTART your PC after enabling each service and application, then open your FIFA 19 to test the issue.

 Once you find the problematic software, you need to uninstall it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.
