### Key Takeaways

 You can automatically remove blank rows in Excel by first selecting your dataset, opening in the ribbon Find & Select > Go To Special, and then selecting "Blanks." Finally, in the ribbon click Delete > Delete Sheet Rows.

 Want to remove all the blank rows from your dataset? If so, Microsoft Excel offers both automatic and manual methods to let you clear the blank rows and shift your data up. Here's how to use those ways.

 When you remove a blank row, [Excel deletes that entire row](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-frolicsome-media-repository-for-2024/) and shifts your data up, so that you no longer have an empty line in your dataset. Remember that you can also simply [hide rows](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-and-tricks-for-apple-id-locked-issue-from-apple-iphone-6-by-drfone-ios/).

##  Automatically Delete All Empty Rows in Excel

 Excel offers an automatic method that finds and [deletes all the blank rows](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-top-online-tools-for-perfecting-your-video-subtitles/) in your worksheet. This way, you don't have to manually find any empty rows and select them to delete---something that's too time-consuming if you have a large dataset.

 To use this method, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then, select the dataset where you want to find and remove [empty rows](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-brand-alliances-elevating-youtube-content/).
