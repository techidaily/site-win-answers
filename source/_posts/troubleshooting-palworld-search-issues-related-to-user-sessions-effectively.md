### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 A smooth and pleasant gaming performance also depends on your graphics card driver. If it’s incompatible, corrupt or out-of-date, you’ll run into various issues including Warcraft 3 crashing. To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, you should update it **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers will regularly roll out new drivers on their official websites:

* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**

 You need to find the driver that exactly corresponds with your Windows version and then download it. Upon completion, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-1-3.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-2-4.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Now launch Warcraft 3 Reforged to test. There should be a significant improvement in the game’s speed after you update the graphics driver. If it doesn’t work this way, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Set high priority for Warcraft 3 Reforged

 Setting a specific application to high priority will make it access more system resources than other running software and thus play smoothly. So, you can boost the priority level for Warcraft 3 Reforged and see how it works.

**1)** Right-click on any empty area on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ta-1-1.jpg)

**2)** Click the**Details** tab. Then, right-click**Warcraft 3\. exe** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-1-6.jpg)

**3)** Mouse over**Set priority** and then click**Above normal** or**High** .

 Re-open Warcraft 3 Reforged and see if the crashing issue is fixed. If not, continue to troubleshoot with the next fix below.

---

### Fix 4 – Close background applications

 Warcraft 3 Reforged sometimes fails to work when too many applications are running in the background. They may cause software conflicts or use up system resources. Make sure all unnecessary programs are closed before you start gaming. Here’s how:

**1)** Right-click on any empty area on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ta-1-1.jpg)

**2)** Right-click each resource-hogging application, and then click **End task**  to close them one by one.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-2-3.jpg)

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Relaunch Warcraft 3 and test if this method helps. If not, you can go for Fix 5 below.

---

### Fix 5 – Stop overclocking

 To gain the best performance, many players attempted to overclock their GPUs. However, doing this is sometimes counterproductive and can render your game unstable. We suggest**lowering your GPU to the default settings** to stop Warcraft 3 Reforged from crashing. If the situation isn’t mitigated with this workaround, turn to the next fix below.

---

### Fix 6 – Lower the graphics settings

 When your PC finds it difficult to handle the high graphics settings, the game will crash. In this case, you should lower the settings.

**1)** Launch Warcraft 3 Reforged.

**2)** Click the**menu icon** in the bottom right corner.
