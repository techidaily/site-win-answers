 As the latest iteration of Ubisoft’s long-running Far Cry series, Far Cry 6 is available now. However, not all players are able to enjoy this title, as some of them**keep getting black screen upon launch** . If you happen to be one of them, don’t worry. A lot of players who are facing the same issue have worked out some effective solutions. In this post, we’ll show you all the fixes you can try!

## Try these fixes

1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Disable the Ubisoft Connect overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Switch to windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 If there are any missing or corrupted game files, you may encounter the black screen issue with Far Cry 6\. Verifying game files may help to resolve installation corruptions that prevent you from being able to play your game. Here’s how:

#### Epic Games Launcher

1. Open the Epic Games Launcher and click**Library** .
2. Click the**three dots** next to Far Cry 6, then select**Verify** .

 It may take a few minutes to verify all your files. Once it’s done, relaunch the game to check if the black screen issue still occurs.

#### Ubisoft Connect

1. Open Ubisoft Connect.
2. Navigate to the**Games** tab, click Far Cry 6 and select**Properties** . Then click**Verify Files** .

3. If prompted, select**Repair** . Ubisoft Connect will then restore any missing or corrupted files.

 Once done, relaunch the game to check if the black screen issue still occurs.

If the issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The black screen issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix the potential problem and ensure your game works properly, you’ll need to make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-nvidia-gtx-1080.jpg)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and launch Far Cry 6 again to see if your problem is resolved.

If you still encounter black screen issues, check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 Microsoft often releases Windows updates with various bug fixes and security improvements. To ensure your operating system is not the problem, you should keep your device up to date. Here’s how:
