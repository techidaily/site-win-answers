## Fix 2: Update your drivers

 The outdated or faulty graphics driver may be causing the Dota 2 FPS dropping issue. If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, you should update or reinstall the driver.

There are mainly two methods for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Dota 2 release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Dota 2 again to see whether the FPS is back to normal. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Turn off the Steam Overlay

 If you have the Steam Overlay turned on and FPS drops while playing Dota 2, just try disabling Steam Overlay for Dota 2 to see FPS increases. Here is how to do it:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Dota 2_ . Then select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![steam dota2 properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/steam-dota2-properties.jpg)
2. In the GENERAL section, Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![Disable steam overlay in Dota 2](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-steam-overlay-in-Dota-2.jpg)

 Launch Dota 2 to see if the game runs smoothly. If the issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Modify Steam launch options for Dota 2

 You can also try using Steam launch options for Dota 2\. If you want a full FPS boost, you can follow the steps below to Launch the game:

1. Launch the Steam client and go to Steam **Library** . **Right-click** on**Dota 2** and select **Properties** .
2. In the **GENERAL** section, enter the command into the textbox under **SET LAUNCH OPTIONS** .  
`**-map dota -high -dx11 +fps_max #**`  
![modify dota 2 steam launch options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/modify-dota-2-steam-launch-options1.jpg)

**Explanation** :

`**-map dota**` : lets Steam load the Dota 2 map right when you launch the game.

`**-high**` : gives Dota 2 high priority CPU usage.

`**-dx11**` : forces your Windows OS run Dota 2 with the Direct3D (-dx11) rendering API. Use this command if your graphics card supports the rendering API DirectX 11.

`**+fps_max #**` : sets the maximum frame per second to the number that has been assigned. You can set the value # to 0 in order to uncap the FPS in the game, or let’s say 144 to cap your frame rate to a specific value. You can try to cap your frame rate to a value your computer can consistently hold.

 Launch Dota 2 to see if you get a better FPS. If not, try the next fix, below.

 Try lowering the in-game graphics setting to see if you’ll gain a FPS boost:

1. Launch Dota 2 and click**the cog icon** on the upper-left corner to open game settings.
2. Navigate to the**VIDEO** tab and follow the instructions below to modify the in-game graphics settings:  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Modify-in-game-settings-dota-2.jpg)

#### Resolution

* Check**Use advanced settings** .
* Select the aspect ratio that suits your monitor.
* **Size** : Select a resolution that is high enough to have a great gaming experience and low enough to save a lot of resources that can be utilized by other settings. (e.g. 1920×1080)
* **Display Mode** : Borderless Window.

 Click**APPLY** to save the changes.

#### Options

Set the rendering API that is recommended by Steam.

#### Rendering

* **Specular**
* **Atmospheric Fog / Caustics**
* **Tree Wind**

 And**disable the rest** .

 If you still experience FPS drops, consider lowering the following settings:

* **Game Screen Render Quality** : set to around**90%**
* **Maximum frames per second allowed** : set to a value above the refresh rate of your monitor and below the maximum FPS you can get.

## Fix 7: Set Dota 2 to High priority

## Fix 9: Set the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance

 A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings that manages how your computer uses power. Windows 10 allows you to customize the power plan on your PC.

 In most cases, the power plan on PCs is configured to**Balanced** , which may limit the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 If the power plan of your PC is **Power saver**  or **Balanced** and you’re experiencing the FPS drops issue, try to change the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .
