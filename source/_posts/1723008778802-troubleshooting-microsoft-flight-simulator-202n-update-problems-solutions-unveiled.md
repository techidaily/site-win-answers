## Fix 1: Change language on Steam

 This fix should resolve the issue with the missing voiceovers. Follow the guide and you’ll get back the audio.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Go to the Steam**Library.**
3. Right-click Dying Light and select**Properties** .
4. Choose Language, then change the language to English and close the tab.
5. Repeat the process, but this time pick your language.

 If you’re already in English, try another language to see if the voices are in this language, then turn back to English.

## Fix 2: Uninstall incompatible app

 Make sure there’s no other software working on the background. It’s possible that some apps are incompatible with Steam which cause the sound issue. Some players figured out when they had Sonic Studio on, there’s an audio mixer or no sound. After installing the software, the Dying Light was working perfectly.

## Fix 3: Update your driver

 Sound issue often relates to your sound card and the audio driver. If your audio driver is outdated or wrongly installed, you may encounter sound issues.

 There’re two ways to update your driver, manually and automatically.  
 You can updating drivers by going to the manufacturer’s official website, then download and install the latest driver which compatible with your operating system.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
