**4)** Relaunch Dota 2 to see if this has resolved your problem.

If not, don’t worry. There are still 5 more fixes to try.

### Fix 2: Rule out driver issues

 One of the most common causes of lags during gameplay is the faulty or incompatible graphics driver. If Dota 2 starts lagging after you updated the graphics driver, you’ll need to **[roll back the driver to the previous version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ; if you haven’t made any changes to the driver, then **[try updating it to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Roll back your graphics driver to the previous version

 To roll back your graphics driver to the previous version, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.

**2)** Enter**devmgmt.msc** , then hit the**Enter** key.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
