## Fix 1 Update your CPU driver

 The Baldur’s Gate 3 high CPU usage problem may occur if you are using the wrong **graphics**  driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. You can head to graphics manufacturers’ websites (like [**Nvidia**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) or **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  ) to download the latest drivers. However, if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Or, you can click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Restart the computer and relaunch the game to see if the problem persists.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 2 Change the power plan setting

 The Baldur’s Gate 3 is running slow or stuttering issue possibly because your computer is using**Energy saving power plan** . Or the default power plan**Balanced** also limits your CPU speed since the device’s priority is to balance performance and energy consumption. To figure that out, follow the steps below to modify your power plan setting.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**I** on your keyboard to invoke Settings.
2. Select**System** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_17-25-54.png)
3. Click**Power & sleep** on the left panel and**Additional power settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_17-25-29.png)
4. Choose the**High performance** power plan.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_17-26-09.png)

Open the game to check for any improvement.

 This fix works in most cases. But some players also found that **reverting the power plan from high-performance mode to balanced mode** helped with the problem. You can also try both modes to see which brings better game performance.

## Fix 3 Set CPU affinity only use 0-3

 Processor affinity enables the binding and unbinding of a process or a thread to a central processing unit (CPU) or a range of CPUs so that the process or thread will execute only on the designated CPU or CPUs rather than any CPU. The main benefit of processor affinity is **optimizing cache performance** .

1. Open the game and press the**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. In the Process tab, right-click on**Baldur’s Gate 3.exe** and select**Go to details** .

3. Right-click on**Baldur’s Gate 3.exe** again and click**Set affinity** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cpu-affinity.jpg)
4. Set the CPU affinity only using**0-3** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cpu-0-3.jpg)

Note: You may need to repeat this process each time you launch the game.

## Fix 4 Allow high graphics performance for the game

 Setting an individual game with high-performance graphics might reduce its CPU usage. That’s because anything that requires GPU in the game will be using GPU, instead of CPU. However, this method has no guaranteed results. You can switch between different modes to see which one works better in easing the Baldur’s Gate 3 high cpu usage headache.

1. Type**graphics settings** in the Windows search bar and click**Graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_18-26-18.png)
2. Click**Browse** and add Baldur’s Gate 3.exe to the list. The default installation location should be **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_18-26-06.png)
3. Once the game executable is added, click**Options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_18-30-16.png)
4. Select**High performance** , then click**Save** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-08-14_18-30-31.png)

Launch the game again to check if the problem has been fixed.

## Fix 5 End unnecessary tasks

 Running too many programs and processes absolutely lowers your system response time. When your GPU and CPU need more time to handle the data transition, it’s usual for game stuttering to occur, even with high FPS. And these tasks add burdens to your CPU usage. To have a better insight into what’s slowing down your system and end those unnecessary tasks, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the taskbar and select **Task Manager** .
