### Fix 2: Check for mod errors

 To see if that’s the issue for you, you can go to**C:\\Users\\Your user name\\documents\\euro truck simulator 2\\** and check the**game.log.txt file** for mod errors.

 If it turns out to be a mod issue, you’ll need to either update the mod or roll back your game to its previous version.

### Fix 3: Clear your game cache files

 Game cache files can also conflict with your game when they get corrupt. You can clear your game cache files to see if that’s the issue for you.

Follow the instructions below to see how:

**1)**  Exit **Steam**  and **your game** completely.

**2)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and **R** at the same time.

**5)** Restart your game to check if this worked for you.

If your game is still unplayable, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics processing unit (GPU), or your graphics card, has the most impact on your gameplay experience. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, it could result in game glitches and long rendering time. So try updating your graphics driver and then running the game again. There are 2 ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-07_15-38-36.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** After updating your graphics driver, try launching your game again to test your issue.

 If the crashing issue continues to occur, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 5:**Run the game as an administrator**

**1)**  Right-click **Steam** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-27_14-35-03.jpg)
