## 3\. Disable antivirus and firewall

 Your firewall and antivirus are diligent gatekeepers, which is great for overall security. However, they can occasionally misinterpret Starfield’s actions as threats. By turning them off briefly, you can check if they’re blocking the game’s launch.

To temporarily disable the Windows Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.

## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

 To make sure those files are intact, you can use the **System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-run-the-system-file-checker.jpg)
5. Now type **sfc /scannow**  and press Enter. Then it’ll start scanning the integrity of all protected operating system files and replace incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions.  

 When you see a message that says “Verification 100% complete”, type**exit** and press Enter.
