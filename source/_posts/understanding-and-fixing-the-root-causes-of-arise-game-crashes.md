 3) Go to C**omputer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\owlcat** and delete the entire key.

 4) Restart your game. Wait for the game to load and don’t alt-tab out.

### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 Some applications can interfere with your Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, especially your antivirus software. To check if this is the cause of ‘Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous not launching’, you can temporarily uninstall your antivirus software because simply disabling it might not work.

 If this doesn’t work, there might be other applications that are conflicting with your game. You might want to **[perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to find the problematic one and uninstall it temporarily.

### Fix 6: Change the GPU priority

 If you have multiple GPUs installed, you might as well try changing the GPU to the dedicated card to see if this helps.

 1) Right-click on any empty area of your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .

![nvidia control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/control-panel.jpg)

 2) Select**Manage 3D Settings** under**3D Settings** .

![manage 3d settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/manage-3D-settings.jpg)

 3) Click on the Program Settings tab and select**Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous** from the drop-down list.
