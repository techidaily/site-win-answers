### Fix 3: Microsoft fix

 The Microsoft support team discovered an issue with a server-side deployment that went out to Insiders and canceled that deployment. You can follow the steps below to get back into a working state on your PC.

1. Press the**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** key on your keyboard together to open the Task Manager.
2. Click**File** and choose**Run new task** .
3. Type cmd and press the Enter key.
4. Copy and paste the following into the command panel. Then hit the Enter key on your keyboard.  
 reg delete HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\IrisService /f && shutdown -r -t 0
5. Your PC will reboot and everything should be back to normal.

### Fix 4: Repair system files

 Windows taskbar issues could be related to the Windows system files. When Windows system files are missing or outdated, it may trigger bugs like the taskbar not working or disappearing from the desktop.

 Therefore, you need a tool to check the system files and repair the corrupted files automatically. If you’re familiar with command codes, you can run**System File Checker** to check the system files. But it takes time and you have to enter the correct command.

 Or, you can turn to a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your PC and fix them automatically. We recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , as it’s tailored to the Windows system and works in a private way.

### Fix 5: Update your graphics driver

 When your graphics driver is outdated or corrupted, it may hinder user interface suche as taskbar to work properly. There are two ways to check if your graphics driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.

**Checking automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
