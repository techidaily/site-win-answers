### Fix 1: Disable your Antivirus software

 It has been proved by many users that some antivirus software like Bitdefender is the reason for the Rainbow Six Siege won’t launch issue. Antivirus software forbidden the game and cause the problem.  
 You can disable your antivirus software temporarily and relaunch the game to see if the problem is resolved.  
 If it works, add Rainbow Six Siege into your antivirus software exception list to fix the problem.

 For Bitdefender users, you can add Rainbow Six Siege into the exception list to avoid the won’t launch issue.  
 Go to**Protection** \>**Advanced Threat Defence** \>**Manage Exceptions.**
 Then add rainbowsix.exe and rainbowsix\_vulkan.exe

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If the game is still crashing, try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Run as administrator

 The privilege issue might be the reason for this problem. With high integrity access, Rainbow Six Siege can make full use of its features, running its function properly. So run the game as an administrator to see if this fixes your issue.

1. Navigate to the game installation folder. (If you can’t find it, you can go to Steam, right-click on the game > Properties > Local Files > Browse local files.)
2. Right-click on**Rainbowsix.exe** and click**Properties** .
3. Click the**Compatibility** tab and check**Run as Administrator** .

4. Click**Apply > OK** .
5. Run the game and check the issue is solved or not.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter Rainbow Six Siege won’t launch issue. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get a better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-rainbow-six-siege-wont-launch/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 4: Verify game cache

**Note** : If you just update your drivers, you need to reboot your computer first.

1. Log out from Uplay and close it.
2. Run Steam. Right-click on the game and click**Properties** .
3. Choose Local files and click**Verify integrity of game files** .

4. Start rainbow six and Uplay will open and ask to link your account
5. Then your game will start automatically!

**Note** : If it doesn’t work, you may restart Steam before doing step 4.  
 If it’s still not working, you can move to the next method.

### Fix 5: Reinstall Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

 If your Siege and Uplay (including the BattleEye) were successfully installed but Rainbow Six Siege won’t launch, you may need to check the supported software.

1. Type “control panel” in the search bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/control.jpg)
2. Set**View in Large icons** and click**Program and Features** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/program.jpg)
3. Find the newest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. Right-click on it and click**Change** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/change.jpg)
4. Click Repair. Then follow the on-screen instructions.  
**Note** : You probably have several of them installed so try and do that Repair for all of them if needed and reboot your computer when asked.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/repair.jpg)
5. Launch Rainbow Six Siege to check.

### Fix 6: Reinstall Uplay

1. Type “control panel” in the search bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/control.jpg)
