1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click Phasmophobia and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-02_18-44-34.png)

5) Relaunch the game to test the issue.

If the game still crashes, try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics processing unit (GPU), or your graphics card, has the most impact on your gameplay experience, and your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, that could cause game glitches such as Phasmophobia crashing issues, so you want to make sure that your graphics driver is updated.

**You can** **manually** **check the driver for your graphics card** by going to the manufacturer’s website (such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)**  , [**Intel**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) or **[Nvidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ,) and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 **If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .** Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-57-32.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_11-58-08.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

4) Relaunch the game to test your issue.

If the crash still occurs, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 5: Lower your graphics settings

 If your computer is not powerful enough to handle Phasmophobia, you may run into performance issues from time to time. One workaround for this is lowering your in-game graphics settings.

1) Launch the game.

2) Go to your game**Settings> Options> Graphics** .

3) Turn down everything as low as possible.

 If you still experience crashing issues, then the issue is not with your game settings. You can change the settings back and try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Launch the game with DirectX 10

 Another workaround for some players is manually switching the game to DirectX 10\. Here’s how to do it:

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click Phasmophobia and select**Properties** .

3) Copy**\-force-feature-level-10-1** and paste it into the**LUNCH OPTIONS** under the General tab.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-22_16-23-03.jpg)

4) Launch the game to see if your problem has been resolved.

If Phasmophobia crashing issues persist, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 7: Stop overlocking your GPU/CPU

 If you’ve manually overclocked your GPU or CPU, revert it to its default GPU/CPU clock. And if you are using overclocking software, such as MSI Afterburner, please also disable the software when running the game.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8: Disable fullscreen optimizations

 Disabling fullscreen optimizations fixes the crashing issue for many games running on the Unity engine. Here’s how to do it:

 1) Right-click the**Phasmophobia icon** and select**Properties** .

 2) Under the Compatibility tab, check the box next to**Disable fullscreen optimizations** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-23_14-53-17.jpg)

 3) Click**Apply > OK** .

 4) Relaunch the game to test your issue.

If the problem still exists, try the next fix below.

### Fix 9: Try Phasmophobia beta version

 If you’re having issues running the current version of Phasmophobia, try running a different game version. You can switch to the beta version of Phasmophobia from Steam, which is generally more optimized than the main game.

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click Phasmophobia and select**Properties** .

3) Go to the**BETAS tab** . Under**Select the beta you would like to opt into** , select a beta version if there’re any available.
