## 6\. Make sure your computer is not overheating

 It’s also worth noting that a very common reason why games crash is that the computer is overheating, especially when the CPU and GPU are running hot. So if the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, or not strong enough for all your hardware components when resource-hungry programs like games are running, then there’ll be problems like sudden computer shut down and constant game crashes, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you run RoboCop: Rogue City, you need a cooler environment for your machine to make sure that the crashing problem doesn’t happen again.

 Here is a detailed post regarding how to check your PC temperature and what you can do to cool your computer down if it’s overheating: **[How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 7\. Repair damaged system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could also help fix crashing problems with games like RoboCop: Rogue City. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for the overall system’s proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause crashes, freezes, and problems that affect gaming performance.

 By repairing the core Windows system files, it may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to instability and crashes in RoboCop: Rogue City. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

 Please note that system file repair alone might not help to fix the RoboCop: Rogue City crashing problem. It’s one troubleshooting step to try, whilst game crashes can also be caused by factors we mentioned above, like outdated graphics drivers, outdated Windows, game file problems, etc. Still, a clean Windows system free of file errors is a good foundation for stable gaming.
