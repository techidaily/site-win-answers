 Missing or damaged game files is a common cause of most gaming issues. So if your Destiny 2 Beyond Light keeps crashing, it’s a good idea to validate the game files first.

1. Launch your Steam client and navigate to the**Library** tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-0.jpg)
2. Right-click**Destiny 2: Beyond Light** from the game list, and click**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Select the**Local Files** tab, and click**Verify Integrity of Game Files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-6.jpg)

 It will take a few minutes for Steam to detect and repair any corrupted files. Upon completion, you can relaunch Beyond Light to see if it crashes again. If yes, proceed to more fixes below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 The Destiny 2 Beyond Light crashing issue may indicate your graphics card driver is corrupted or out-of-date. To ensure a smooth and immersive gaming experience, you should keep your graphics driver up-to-date at all times.

 To update your graphics driver the safe way, here are two options: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Update the graphics driver manually

 GPU manufacturers keep releasing new drivers to fix bugs with new titles and improve game performance. You can visit their official websites and download the correct drivers corresponding with your Windows version:

* **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Update the graphics driver automatically (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-1-4.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). You can also click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-2-5.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Test how Destiny 2 Beyond Light works after the driver update. If the crashes persist, move on to the next fix below.

1. Right-click any empty space on the taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-1-4.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-1-5.jpg)
3. Right-click the**Destiny 2: Beyond Light.exe file** . Then, mouse over**Set priority** and select**Above normal** or**High** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

### Fix 4 – Disable the shader cache

 If you’re using an NVIDIA graphics card, it’s possible the shader cache has messed up with Destiny 2 Beyond Light and caused the glitches. Try disabling this option to see if the crash stops.

1. Right-click any blank area on the desktop, and click**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0">vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-3-3.jpg)
2. Click**3D Settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** on the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-4-3.jpg)
3. Under the Global Settings section, scroll down and**turn off Shader Cache** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-2-2.jpg)
4. Go to**C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA Corporation\\NV\_Cache** and**delete the content of that folder** . (You can also copy them and store them elsewhere.)

 Launch Beyond Light again and the crashing problem should no longer occur. If not, go to Fix 5 below.

### Fix 5 – Reinstall Destiny 2: Beyond Light

 A fresh reinstallation can effectively solve stubborn underlying program issues. So, if you’ve attempted all the fixes above but to no avail, try reinstalling the game as a last resort.

1. Open Steam and click the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-0.jpg)
2. Right-click**Destiny 2 Beyond Light** and click**Manage** \>**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-2-2.jpg)
3. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer.
